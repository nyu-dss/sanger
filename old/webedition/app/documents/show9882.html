        <h1>MORALITY AND BIRTH CONTROL</h1>
        <h3 class="italics">By Margaret Sanger</h3>
        <p>Throughout the ages, every attempt woman has made to strike off the shackles of slavery
            has been met with the argument that such an act would result in the downfall of her
            morality. Suffrage was going to "break up the home." Higher education would unfit her
            for motherhood, and co-education would surely result in making her immoral. Even today,
            in some of the more backward countries reading and writing is stoutly discouraged by the
            clerical powers, because "women may read about things they should not know."</p>
        <p>We now know that there never can be a free humanity until woman is freed from ignorance,
            and we know, too, that woman can never call herself free until she is mistress of her
            own body. Just so long as man dictates and controls the standards of sex morality, just
            so long will man control the world.</p>
        <p>Birth control is the first important step woman must take toward the goal of her freedom.
            It is the first step she must take to be man's equal. It is the first step they must
            both take toward human emancipation.</p>
        <p>The Twentieth Century can make progress only by fighting the superstitions and prejudices
            created in the Nineteenth Century -- fighting them in the open with the public
            searchlight upon them.</p>
        <p>The first questions we must ask ourselves are: Are we satisfied with present day
            morality? Are we satisfied with the results of present day standards of morality? Are
            these so satisfying that they need no improvement?</p>
        <p>For fourteen years I worked as a nurse in the factory and tenement districts of New York City. Eight years ago I was called into a home
            where the father, a machinist by trade, was earning eighteen dollars a week. He was at
            the time the father of six living children, to all appearances a sober, serious and hard
            working man. His wife, a woman in the thirties toiled early and late helping him to keep
            the home together and the little ones out of the sweatshops, for they were both anxious
            to give their children a little schooling.</p>
        <p>Two years ago I came across this same family, and found that five more children had been
            added in the meantime to their household. The three youngest were considered by medical
            authorities to be hopelessly feeble-minded, two of the older girls were prostitutes;
            three of the boys were serving long term sentences in penitentiaries, while another of
            the children had been injured by a fall and so badly crippled that she will not be able
            to help herself for years to come.</p>
        <p>Out of this family of eleven children only two are now of any use to society, a little
            girl of seven, who stays at home and cares for her crippled sister during the day while
            the mother scrubs office floors, and a boy of nine who sells chewing gum after school
            hours at a subway exit. The father has become a hopeless drunkard, of whom the mother
            and children live in terror.</p>
        <p>This is but one illustration of the results of our present day morality. Here was an
            opportunity for society to develop and preserve six children for human service; but
            prudery and ignorance added five more to this group, with the result that two out of
            eleven are left to fit the struggle against pauperism and charity. Will they
            succumb?</p>
        <p>Another case I should like to cite shows how shallow is the concern of society in regard
            to the over-crowded tenements, where thousands of little children occupy sleeping
            quarters with parents and boarders whose every act is visible to all. Morality indeed!
            Society is much like the ostrich with its head in the sand. It will not look at facts
            and face the responsibility of its own stupidity.</p>
        <p>I recall the death-bed scene, when the patient, a woman of twenty-six, passed away during
            the birth of her seventh child. Five out of the seven were girls, the eldest being about
            ten years old. Upon the death this woman, this girl began to assume the duties of her
            mother and continued to keep the four men roomers who had lodged in their home for
            years. A few years later, I found this girl suffering from the ravages of syphilis,
            although she had only just entered the period of puberty. She told me she could not
            remember when she had not dressed and undressed before the roomers, and on winter nights
            she often slept in their beds. She was already old--old in ignorance, in vulgarity, in
            degeneracy.</p>
        <p>Another womanhood blighted in the bud, battered by ignorance, another soul sunk in
            despair.</p>
        <p>These five girl-women did not ask society to fill their minds, as it was willing to do,
            with a useless knowledge of Greek, Latin or the Sciences. But they did need and
            unconsciously demand the knowledge of life, of hygiene and sex psychology which is so
            prudishly and shamefully denied them. No doubt these five sisters will soon represent
            the ruins of an ancient prejudice, and five more derelicts will be added to that
            particular relic heap of humanity.</p>
        <p>Again, is there anything more sickening to truth than the attitude of society toward that
            catch phrase "Sacred Motherhood"? Take another illustration and lay bare the living
            facts and view them for awhile.</p>
        <p>Two sisters lived in an upstate town, members of a large family, where the older
            daughters worked in factories, in order that the younger girls might have educational
            advantages. The youngest fell in love with a good-for-nothing fellow, with the result
            that she had an illegal child. Disgrace, ostracism and remorse drove her out into the
            world, and together with her baby she drifted from house to house in the capacity of a
            servant, until finally the baby died, leaving the mother free to enter upon another
            vocation. During this time, however, due to the condescending treatment accorded to her
            by the women who employed her, she had become so accustomed to look upon herself as an
            outcast that soon, with other companions of her own frame of mind, she began
            trafficking....on the streets of New York. </p>
        <p>Now, the second sister, a few years older, also fell in love with one of the "town
            heroes," and came to grief; but owing to the "disgrace" of the youngest sister and
            sympathy for the elder members of the family, who were completely anguish stricken over
            this second mishap, the old family physician took her in charge and sent to her a place
            where an illegal operation was performed upon her. She returned, a sadder but wiser
            girl, to her home, finished the high school course, and several years later she became
            the principal of a school.</p>
        <p>Today she is one of the most respected women in that county. She devotes her life outside
            school hours to a sympathetic understanding of the needs of young boys and girls, and
            her sordid early experience, put to good use, has helped many boys and girls to lead
            clean lives.</p>
        <p>These cases represent actual modern conditions. Our laws force women into celibacy on the
            one hand, or abortion on the other. Both conditions are declared by eminent medical
            authorities to be injurious to health. The ever ascending standard and cost of living,
            combined with the low wage of the young men of today, tend toward the postponement of
            marriage.</p>
        <p>Has the knowledge of birth control, so carefully guarded and so secretly practiced by the
            women of the wealthy class--and so tenaciously withheld from the working women--brought
            them misery? Rather, has it not promoted greater happiness, greater freedom, greater
            prosperity and more harmony among them? The women who have this knowledge are the women
            who have been free to develop, free to enjoy in its best sense, and free to advance the
            interests of the community. And their men are the ones who motor, who sail yachts, who
            legislate, who lead and control. The men, women and children of this class do not form
            any part whatever in the social problems of our times.</p>
        <p>Had this class continued to reproduce in the prolific manner of the working people in the
            past twenty-five years, can human imagination picture what conditions would be
            today?</p>
        <p>All of our problems are the result of overbreeding among the working class, and if
            morality is to mean anything at all to us, we must regard all the changes which tend
            toward the uplift and survival of the human race as moral.</p>
        <p>Knowledge of birth control is essentially moral. Its general, though prudent, practice
            must lead to a higher individuality and ultimately to a cleaner race.</p>
