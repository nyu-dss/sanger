        <h1>
            Bombay
        </h1>
        <p>The question of population has recently been receiving national and international
            consideration by specialists in the various fields--of biology, sociology, economics,
            psychology, demography etc All isolated &amp; remote from those who produce
            population--the parents. &amp; particularly the mother.</p>
        <p> While these specialists are gravely alarmed over special aspects of the falling birth
            rates in certain circles, they fail to consider the facts which the parents of today are
            bound to consider in taking up the responsibility of parenthood.</p>
        <p> 1st the possible inheritances of the child 2nd its needs of the future.</p>
        <p> There has been a great psychological change which has taken place in the lives of
            millions of parents &amp; parents to be. Instead of allowing chance to dictate &amp;
            manage their lives, they apply intelligence, knowledge, Science &amp; bring children
            consciously into being by choice.</p>
        <p> In this way they give consideration to the health of the mother; the health &amp; future
            possibilities of the child. The earning powers &amp; ambitions of the father.</p>
        <p> In fact responsibility toward children &amp; the desire of parents to give the best in
            life to their offspring.</p>
        <p> Also the desire of parents to prolong their own usefulness to society to their
            professions; to prolong the age of learning--to advance their cultural &amp; educational
            possibilities &amp; to enjoy their adult &amp; mature life to the best of their
            ideals.</p>
        <p> These are the factors that underlie the falling birth rates in the Western
            Countries.</p>
        <p> The time has come to dispute &amp; challenge those who would encourage numbers &amp; the
            increase of population regardless of the personal factors of responsibility &amp;
            health.</p>
        <p> Men &amp; women are not mere statistical units who are born, marry produce their kind
            &amp; die.</p>
        <p> We must regard their personal contribution as of value, the quality of material with
            which they are endowed thru inheritance as of infinitely more value to society &amp; the
            race than numbers. It is to this quality that we must now <span class="del">turn</span>
            
       &#8593;direct&#8595;
     our attention if civilization is to endure or advance.</p>
        <p> In the past reproduction has been left to chance now man may thru science choose whether
            he will become a god or fall back into barbarism.</p>
        <p> Education of the masses does not mean that 
       &#8593;it&#8595;
     is the transmission of the best
            racial qualities in our population.</p>
        <p> The type of mind of the unskilled laborer the manual worker belongs to the past. These
            classes have served their purpose &amp; reached the limit of their usefulness Their need
            in society is greatly reduced by invention &amp; machinery--today &amp; will be more
            limited in the near future by Chemistry &amp; physics &amp; the possession of unlimited
            sources of heat &amp; Energy at a 
        [<em>minimum</em>?]
     of expenditure. Instead of
            manual laborers we shall need brains highly resistant to work &amp; capable of a degree
            of instruction which surpasses that of the most intelligent of our skilled workers
            today. Consequently it is a crime against the future civilization &amp; generations to
            encourage the reproduction of mediocre, diseased, or inferior groups who shall become a
            burden to the future &amp; retard the progress of civilization.</p>
        <p> There must be a Scientific 
       &#8593;Study&#8595;
     of Population in each Country &amp; this
            shall point the way for legislation to deliver society from the burdens now heaped upon
            it by eliminating the reproduction of dysgenic 
        [<em>stock</em>?]
    .</p>
        <p> Tuberculosis--
       &#8593;from&#8595;
     of which a large part of the population is suffering.</p>
        <p> 99 out of 100 cases it was found that the patient could not afford a tolerable course of
            treatment &amp; rest.</p>
        <p> This is 
        [<em>destructly</em>?]
     a disease of poor nutrition &amp; bad housing
            &amp; overcrowding.</p>
        <p> The father can not abscent himself from work long enough to get properly cured. The
            mother has to get up earlier from her convalescence to attend to the needs of her
            husband &amp; her children.</p>
        <p> The child<span class="del">ren</span> that <span class="del">are</span>
            
       &#8593;is&#8595;
     ill needs the full vigor &amp; vitality of the mother for its care &amp;
            treatment. Thus the condition of a pregnant mother enfeebles her &amp; often prevents
            the cure of the infant.</p>
        <p> It is absolutely impossible to afford the care &amp; treatment of disease so the only
            possible solution is to prevent the cause of disease--also to prevent the conception of
            more children in the family than the income will provide decently for.</p>
        <p> To bring a baby into the world costs more today than at any time in our history.</p>
        <p> Children 
       &#8593;today&#8595;
     are a luxury. It costs more to feed, clothe &amp; educate his
            children according to present day standards than it cost for 
       &#8593;a family of&#8595;
     six
            twenty five years ago--! Children must be properly fed--properly clothed--They
            themselves have standards set up by their associates--</p>
        <p> There must be more schooling laws require longer periods in schools. They can not go to
            work &amp; be self supporting as early as was allowed a generation ago.</p>
        <p> On top of all the expenses the parents must meet for their own children they must pay in
            the form of taxes for the hordes of children whose fathers can not provide for--Taxes
            have gone up to pay for those on relief--Those who are unemployed--Those who are sick
            &amp; unfit &amp; can not compete in the struggle for existence. The financial burdens
            The government has placed upon the 
       &#8593;bent&#8595;
     backs of the tired &amp; discouraged
            fathers of 
	[<em>two words unclear</em>]
	 families, will continue to grow
            heavier unless Something is done to decrease the birth rate of the unfit. It is now
            legally possible for our country &amp; State health authorities to see to it that
            parents who can not provide for two children should be advised not to have <span class="underlined">ten</span>! And given the information &amp; means to prevent that
            catastrophe,
