        <h1>WHAT EVERY GIRL SHOULD KNOW</h1>
        <h3>By MARGARET H. SANGER. </h3>
        <h2>I--Reproduction.</h2>
        <p>In the preceding article on Sexual Impulse I said that the
            natural aim of the sexual impulse is the sexual act, and the natural aim of the sexual
            act is reproduction.</p>
        <p>In teaching children or young persons the process of reproduction one of the cleanest,
            most natural and beautiful methods of doing this is to tell them the process which goes
            on in the various forms of life in the flower, fish, frog, bird and animal, leading up
            to the highest and most complex of all living creatures--man.</p>
        <p> In a series or articles written for this page a year ago I told how this subject had
            been taught to a group of children in this way. They watched the butterfly and bee carry
            a load of pollen from the father buttercup to fertilize the seeds within the mother
            flower. They watched Mr. and Mrs. Frog awaken from their long winter nap, and stirred by
            the life-giving impulse within them, start for the breeding pond. They watched Father
            Thrush win his mate and patiently stand guard over her during the tedious hatching days.
            They were told and saw that the that the flowers depended upon outside forces to bring
            the pollen from the male to the female to fertilize the seeds before the seeds could
            grow. They were taught that the mother fish lays her eggs in the water first and that
            the father fish, unlike the flowers, being able to move about, carries the pollen (which
            is now a fluid) to the seeds himself. They were told that Father Frog, being a higher
            creature, fertilized the eggs before they reached the water, and Father Thrush being
            still higher in the scale fertilized the eggs before they left the mother's body. That
            the higher the species was, the greater the care required to preserve that species.</p>
        <p>In this way the mind is prepared for the information which should follow.</p>
        <p> The girl at puberty should be taught this process and something of what goes on within
            the womb after the ovum has been fertilized. She should know that all organic life is
            the result of a simple cell; that man is a community of cells, banded together and
            depending upon each cell to carry on its work, for the benefit of the whole.</p>
        <p> Let us first, then, get an idea of a cell and what it is and what it does. A cell is a
            tiny portion of living matter having in its center a spot or nucleus which represents
            the point of germination; it is separated from its sister cells by partitions of cell
            membrane.</p>
        <p>A simple cell is formed by the fusion of two germ cells when they meet to exchange
            nuclear elements. After this fusion they are able to proceed with fission which means
            splitting into parts and it is the subsequent cellular growth of the fused germcell that
            constitutes reproduction.</p>
        <p>There are two kinds of reproductive cells, the ova in the female and the spermatozoa in
            the male.</p>
        <p>When the sexual act takes place, there is deposited into the vagina a secretion know as
            semen. According to Sutkowsky, each deposit or
            ejaculation contains 50,000,000 of spermatozoa.</p>
        <p>About the same time in the act there occurs in the female spasmodic contractions of the
            muscles of the uterus which draws in a small amount of the sperm which the male has left
            there.</p>
        <p>The sperm cell of the male under the microscope shows that it contains both a head and a
            tail.</p>
        <p>The tail enables it to move and advance with a tadpole-like motion toward the ovum.</p>
        <p>As in the lower forms of life, the male cell has within it the instinct to chase and
            capture the female cell. Consequently, it does not depend upon the uterine contractions
            of the female to enable it to reach the ovum for fertilization. The vagina being a
            corrugated or wrinkled tube, hides and secretes the sperm cell for days, unless it is
            removed with water or killed by poison.</p>
        <p>When, however, the sperm comes near the ovum it is drawn to it as to a magnet.</p>
        <p>The ovum being carefully protected by nature within the ovaries, leaves its sister cells
            and travels alone. The sperm cell, however, having more dangerous paths to travel, must
            provide against the uncertainty of doing its great work by going in numbers, though it
            takes but one single cell to produce human life.</p>
        <p>A number of the male cells go to meet the ovum, but only one enters it. Almost at the
            moment the head enters the ovum it becomes completely absorbed by the ovum and all trace
            of it is lost.</p>
        <p>This union of the two cells is called fertilization, fecundation, impregnation, or
            conception. Any of these terms may be used. This union usually takes place in the tube,
            but the fertilized egg does not remain there; it wanders along and finds its way into
            the uterus.</p>
        <p>Now, that the ovum has been fertilized, it readily becomes attached to the soft lining of
            the uterus which has been specially prepared to receive it. No menstruation occurs. The
            woman is now pregnant. A new being is created, and marvelous changes will now take place
            within the tiny cell clinging so weakly to the lining of the uterus. At this time the
            ovum is so small it can scarcely be seen by the naked eye, but in two weeks it has grown
            to the size of a pea, in four weeks to the size of a walnut and in eight weeks to the
            size of a lemon. At this time it is three inches long and is completely formed, the head
            being much larger in proportion to the rest of its body. What has happened to the ovum
            in these few weeks is briefly this: Immediately after fertilization the ovum begins to
            divide into sections or lobes, into 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.--cells until they are almost
            countless. Each cell splits in the middle of the nucleus, forming two complete new cells
            and so on.</p>
        <p>The next stage is represented by this mass of cells forming themselves into a shape like
            a hollow ball. The third stage is the meeting of the two layers of cells, as if the bell
            had collapsed, and these two layers meet and unite as one, stretch and flatten out.</p>
        <p>After this stage things become more complicated, new organs begin to develop, spine marks
            for the backbone and intestinal canal show themselves as do the bony and muscular
            structure of the skeleton.</p>
        <p>A slight pulsation is observed, showing the development of the heart. The head fold is
            formed by a gradual bending of the spinal column at the front end of the ovum, which we
            will now call the embryo. There are also formed at this time processes which soon become
            arms and legs, there is a furrow for the face; pits for the eyes; all of which has
            happened in less than four weeks.</p>
        <p>From this time forward development is rapid, the bones, which up to this time have been
            soft matter, grow harder, and all organs which were only outlined now become definitely
            formed. At the end of the fourth month it has grown to its natural shape. The remaining
            months it increases in size and gains strength. The uterus becomes enlarged, rises out
            of the pelvis and occupies the abdominal cavity. It takes forty weeks or 280 days to
            complete the growth of the human embryo, although the time may be two weeks more or less
            and yet be normal.</p>
        <p>Let us see how the child has been fed all this time. When the ovum is fertilized and up
            to the eighth week it is fed by delicate branched threads which form a covering for it.
            These threads are called "villa," and dip into the uterine surface for nourishment, from
            the mother to supply the embryo.</p>
        <p>About the eighth week these villa have grown greatly intertwined into a mass of spongy
            tissue full of blood vessels called the placenta, or afterbirth. This fastens itself to
            one side of the uterus, takes oxygen as well as nutriment from the mother and sends it
            through the umbilical cord to the child, the point of attachment being at the navel, the
            depression left on the belly of the child by the cutting of umbilical cord at birth. In
            the same way it takes the waste product from the child to the mother, and she in turn
            throws them out of her system through the kidneys, bowels and skin. The child and
            placenta are both encased within a membranous sac which secretes and serves to hold a
            watery fluid in which the child swims.</p>
        <p>The child is folded together with legs on the thighs and thighs on the belly, arms on the
            chest and head bent forward over the breast. Toward the end of the term it moves about
            slightly, often stretches a little, and has periods of rest when it scarcely moves, and
            again periods of great activity. A mother first feels the child move in the fourth or
            fifth month. Often the young mother at this time begins to worry over her acts lest
            something she should do might deform the precious charge she carries. This, as you can
            readily understand from its early development, is impossible, for by the end of the
            second month the child has been formed, and no mental impressions of the mother can
            alter its shape. Just as the nucleus of the male sperm has within it all the
            contributions which the father of the child can give it, until after it is born, so does
            the mother give it its physical qualitites right at the beginning.</p>
        <p>Whatever is to be inherited from the father must be within the substance of the
            spermatozoon at the time the ovum is fertilized. He has no further pre-natal influence
            over it.</p>
        <p>It is interesting to observe that the children of so-called great men are seldom above
            the average in intelligence, where, on the other hand, almost all men of great minds
            have had intelligent mothers.</p>
        <p>How great or how little influence a mother has over her child through her thoughts has
            not been proven, nor has the subject of determining or influencing sex of the unborn
            child been settled.</p>
        <p>At the end of nine months the child's development is complete and it is ready for its
            journey to the outside world. The process of this journey is called"labor"--a word which
            will describe the mother's share in it. When this occurs before the embryo is able to
            live outside the uterus it is known as abortion and we will continue that subject next
            week.</p>
        <p>(To be continued.)</p>
