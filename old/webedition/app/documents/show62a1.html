        <h1>
       &#8593;Pressures of Population as a Cause of War&#8595;
    </h1>
        
            <p>The Causes of War are manifold and diverse. There have been wars of aggression and
                wars of defense.</p>
            <p>Motives have been hidden behind religious and dynastic interests. Today more than
                ever before in the history of our complex civilizations is it difficult to attribute
                a given war to any one particular cause.</p>
            <p>It is certain that the official reasons given are seldom the actual causes which
                plunge nations and peoples into war. One stands appalled at the trumped up motives
                of despots, tyrants dictators, for which tens of thousands 
       &#8593;of able bodied
                    men&#8595;
     have been slain in battles, while cities, towns, even countries of
                beauty and wealth have been sacked and destroyed.</p>
            <p>The reasons given (if given at all) for this wholesale mad destruction are usually
                &#8220;blinds&#8221; or &#8220;leads&#8221; for popular prejudice to inflame the masses into action.</p>
            <p>Reasons for &#8220;wars of defense&#8221; are manipulated by diplomats.</p>
            <p>Wars to end wars become an occasion and a pretext.</p>
            <p>Wars of Idealistic and Religious motives seem more righteous and worthy than motives
                of economic rivalry for markets and world trade. So these sordid motives are kept in
                the background.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge that racial and religious differences have been the cause of war, and
                though religion teaches the duty of loving our neighbors as ourselves, &#8220;religious
                wars&#8221; have continued unabated.</p>
            <p>In Ireland it is the Catholics against the Protestants.</p>
            <p>In India the Mohammedans against the Hindus who continue to attack
                each other in savage fury, and while we realize that religious and racial
                animosities have been the cause of war in many parts of the world in the past, it is
                now generally accepted by experts in the field that <span class="underline">economic
                    factors</span> have been preeminent in causing wars and that religious or racial
                differences have become subjected to the all-important factor of economic rivalry,
                which <span class="underline">was</span> the dominant factor in the World War, as it
                has continued to be in World Politics at the <span class="underline">present
                    time</span>.</p>
            <p>From 1910 to 1914 German authorities were issuing statements of warnings to the world
                that her population was increasing to the explosion point, and that her needs of
                expansion were dominating her every political and economic move.</p>
        
        
            <p> 1901 -- &#8220;In Conquest and Kultur&#8221; by Arthur Dix:</p>
        
        
            <p>&#8220;Because the German people nowadays increase at the rate of 800,000
                    inhabitants in a year, they need both room and nourishment for the
                surplus....</p>
            <p>&#8220;As a world power in the world market we must assert our place and
                    make it secure in order that the younger hands may find room and opportunity for
                    employment.&#8221;</p>
            
                Von Berhardi in his
                        &#8220;Germany and the Next War&#8221;
                    published in 1911 states:
                 &#8220;Strong, healthy, flourishing nations increase in number. From a
                        given moment they require a continual expansion of their frontiers.
                &#8220;They require new territory for the accommodation of their surplus
                        population.
                &#8220;Since almost every part of the globe is inhabited, new territory
                        must be obtained at a cost <span class="underline">to its possessors</span>
                        -- that is to say <span class="underline">by conquest</span> which thus
                        becomes a law of necessity. Again in 1912 -- <span class="underline">von
                        Bernhardi wrote:</span>
                &#8220;We must endeavor to acquire new territories throughout the world
                            <span class="underline">by all means in our power</span>, because we must
                        preserve to Germany the millions of Germans who will be born
                        in the future, and we must provide for them food and employment. They ought
                        to be able to live under a German sky, and to lead a German life.&#8221;
            
            
                These statements by German writers and statesmen 
       &#8593;express&#8595;
     a simple,
                        <span class="underline">universal</span> and eternal truth. That the growth
                    of population with the resulting desire and need for economic expansion was a
                    necessary cause of war <span class="underline">Yesterday</span> is <span class="underline">Today</span> and will be <span class="underline">Tomorrow</span>, unless we recognize that vital factor and do something
                    about it.
                The World War had brought out startling facts regarding population growth .
                <span class="underline">While</span> the birth rate of Europe has steadily
                    declined during the last 100 years, the population from 1800, which was
                    200,000,000 rose to 600,000,000 by the year 1914, and during this period -- from
                    1845 to 1914 -- (or a period of 70 years) 50,000,000 persons emigrated from
                        Europe to other parts of the globe, and yet we have as an
                    example of this 70-year period the <span class="underline">explosion of the
                        dynamic power of fertility</span> which ended ina World War and nearly
                    destroyed our civilization!!!
            
            
                <span class="underline">Emigration is not the answer to prevent war.</span>
            
            
                <h2>General Population Facts</h2>
                Before taking up the problem of the separate nations, which we will designate as
                        <span class="underline">high pressure</span> and <span class="underline">low
                        pressure</span> countries, I would like to state the following:
                Man&#8217;s inherent capacity to incrrase his numbers is practically unlimited, while
                    the earth&#8217;s tillable surface and its natural resources are definitely limited.
                            
       &#8593;H. G. Wells&#8595;
    
                before the 19th Century the growth of population was everywhere slow even
                    stationary in some places.
                While accurate population statistics for the whole world are lacking, a
                    conservative estimate would indicate the following:
                That the population of the world is approximately 2,000 million people, It has
                        <span class="underline">increased 27,000,000 in 8 years,</span> (or from 1924
                    to 1932).
                The density of population was estimated 1932 to be about 40 per square mile.
                    Later we will see that this is conservative
                            
       &#8593;
        [<em>underestimate</em>?]
    &#8595;
    .
            
            
                &#8220;MULTIPLYING MAN&#8221; by Pearl
                &#8220;In the last analysis the living of every human being must come
                        out of the earth
                &#8220;Each individual now living has available about 16 acres of land,
                        half of which is useless.&#8221;
                Pearl then turns to the chemical aspect of the population problem -- Carbon, the
                    most important element for the maintenance of life -- The most serious aspect of
                    the problem is not food production but the rapid rate at which industrial and
                    commercial modes of life are using up basic resources.
            
            
                <h2 class="underline">ACREAGE AND FOODS</h2>
                100 acres of wheat land will support 208 persons a year
                100 acres of milk producing pasture supports 41 persons
                100 acres beef producing pasture supports 9 persons
                About one-half the population of the world lives on rice or cereal, and know
                    nothing of meat, cheese and milk 
       &#8593;eggs or fruits&#8595;
    .
                According to Prof. E.M. East there are
                    13 thousand million acres of tillable soil available, of which two-fifths is now
                    under cultivation.
                And since it takes 2 1/2 acres of land, according to our own present standards of
                    living, to support each individual in countries like the United
                        States, England and France, it is
                    clear that these standards cannot be maintained if the population continues to
                    increase, and that even on a lower standard of living the world cannot sustain
                    more than <span class="underline">5 thousand million</span> at the most.
                If we deduct from this area now under cultivation the mountains the deserts, the
                    rivers, streams, towns, roads, forests, far less than two-fifths would be
                    left.
                It is safer to say that the density of population in the world is 80 people per
                    square mile today.
                The U.S. Department of
                        Agriculture has published <span class="underling">four</span> dietetic
                    scales, with the necessary land to support them. the <span class="underline">lowest diet</span> necessary to keep <span class="underline">very poor
                        people</span>
       &#8593; Germany 9 months of war&#8595;
     from starving on a <span class="underline">temporary</span> basis, requires 1.2 acres of land an
                    adult.
                The next <span class="underline">minimum</span> diet consistent with the average
                    health is 1.8 acres of land.
                And the third ordinary diet of the <span class="underline">middle-class</span>
                    standard is 2.3 acres.
                And the <span class="underline">ideal</span> for <span class="underline">health</span> and vitality demands 3.1 acres per individual.
                The League of Nations statistics on the facts of living show that the
                    highest standards of life are maintained for the largest number of people in the
                        United States, Canada,
                        Australia, New Zealand -- all which have a
                    thin population and low birth rate.
                We must know that the majority of the population of the world, especially in
                    countries like India and China. 
       &#8593;Even&#8595;
    
                    Russia with high birth rates, live permanently
                    on the lowest standard, which only &#8220;low pressure&#8221; countries like the United
                    States, France, England, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, low birth rate
                    countries, can maintain the ideal diet.
                So much for the diet and the food possibilities and the land!
                And now let us take 
       &#8593;up&#8595;
     some of the vital factors in our population
                    growth:
                Population experts have recently been shedding crocodile tears and issuing grave
                    warnings to the people of the &#8220;low pressure&#8221; population countries, because the
                    birth rates of these countries <span class="underline">are declining</span>.
                They emphasize the declining birth rate but they fail to tell us that the
                    population of these countries are nevertheless increasing.
                Let me give you a simple example of birth rates and how to compute them.
                Interest 40% on $1000. would equal $400.
                Interest 2% on $1,000,000 would give you $20,000.
            
            
                <h2>&#8220;High Pressure&#8221; -- &#8220;Low Pressure&#8221; Countries</h2>
                
       &#8593;High&#8595;
     Germany, Italy and Japan constitute
                    what is now termed the &#8220;<span class="underline">high pressure</span>&#8221;
                    nations.
                
       &#8593;Low&#8595;
     England, United States, South America, Australia,
                    Canada, Scandinavian countries constitute the
                    &#8220;low pressure&#8221; nations.
                In 43 years or from the end of the Franco-Prussian war to
                    1910, Germany&#8217;s population increased 24,000,000.
                At the beginning of the World War in
                    1914 her population was approximately 68,000,000 with an area of 208,780 square
                    miles.
                
       &#8593;<span class="underline">20 years later</span>&#8595;
    Today, nearly twenty years
                    later, or 1933 her population is approximately 66,000,000 in an area of 186,000
                    square miles.
                
                    <h2>COSTS</h2>
                    The World War costs Germany 27,000 square miles thru her territorial loss and
                        deaths approximately 10,000,000 in population.
                
                
                    <h2>DENSITY</h2>
                    In 1914 the density of population was 404 per square mile -- the danger
                        signal for any nation. In her density is 256 per square mile!!!
                
            
            
                
       &#8593;What does density mean.&#8595;
    
            
            
                <h2>ACREAGE: per person</h2>
                 When we remember that there are 640 acres to the square mile and it takes at
                    least 2 1/2 acres to feed every individual, you can figure out for yourselves
                    what is bound to happen if this condition continues.
            
            
                <h2>Birth Rates</h2>
                 The birth rate in Germany went up in 1934 to 18.9 and her death rate went down
                    11.8. 
       &#8593;In spite of Heroic Efforts.&#8595;
     The birth rate thruout the world
                    seemed to take a step upward in that year 1934, <span class="underline">except in
                        Italy</span>.

                <h2>AGRICULTURE</h2>
                Any further agricultural development in Germany 
       &#8593;is&#8595;
     impossible as even
                    in 
       &#8593;as far back as&#8595;
     1914 she had already utilized all fertile land.
            
            
                <h2>EMIGRATION</h2>
                 Emigration, however, was her release. All doors of the world were open to German
                    emigrants up to the World War.
            
            
                <h2>NATIONAL ASSETS</h2>
                A German was an asset to any nation Educated robust, strong, intelligent,
                    thorough in his undertakings and habit, clean, highly trained mechanics, experts
                    in all lines of industry, linguists in the various languages of Europe and the
                    Balkans; scientists taking no second place with any nation; advanced in
                    medicine, the arts and chemistry.
            
            
                <h2>NO RETURNS</h2>
                For all this training from childhood by the Govt. Germany had no returns on this human investment, because she
                    did not have sufficient colonies to utilize this human equipment.
                
       &#8593;While&#8595;
     Few Germans went to South Africa
                    <span class="">colonies</span>, Large numbers went elsewhere.

                Today the only country in the world that has not 
       &#8593;yet&#8595;
     banned emigrants
                    is South America. But a large <span class="underline">industrial</span>
                    population such as might emigrate from Germany is not useful where <span class="underline">agricultural</span> needs are urgent and required.
            
            
                <h2><span class="underline">RAW MATERIAL:</span></h2>
                 Germany like Italy and Japan needs raw material for her industries, the
                    manufacturing of which she will exchange for food.
            
            
                <h2>LACKING</h2>
                 She lacks oil, rubber, cotton, steel, and copper as well as food.
            
            
                The <span class="underline">condition of Germany today</span> is that she is not
                    ready for war. She is not going to be trapped in isolation again as she was in
                    the World War.
                Her new program of rearmament is not only <span class="underline">military</span>
                    preparedness by <span class="underline">industrial</span> as well and she is
                    bending all her efforts on a system of <span class="underline">self-sufficiency</span> for these necessities which she is lacking.
                Nevertheless she <span class="underline">does not intend</span> to <span class="underline">decrease</span> her birth rate nor to control her
                    population growth.

       &#8593;Gen Goering&#8595;
    </h1>
                In November, 1936, General
                        Goering stated:
                &#8220;The territory in which the Germans live is too small for the
                        66,000,000 inhabitants and will soon be too small for the 70,000,000,
                        80,000,000, 90,000,000 which we <span class="underline">want</span> to
                        become.&#8221;
                Where is the League of Nations and what is their reply to this challenge to
                    International Peace?
                <span class="underline">ABSOLUTE  SILENCE</span>
                Had the jurists, lawyers, professors, soldiers, politicians, who made the Treaty of Versailles been less ignorant of concrete <span class="underline">realities</span> that after having disarmed Germany,
                    instead of providing a safety valve against the day when the population boiler
                    would again <span class="underline">bubble</span> and <span class="underline">explode</span>, they had either made provision for Germany&#8217;s expansion or
                    insisted that she restrain her increasing fertility to the territory assigned to
                    her. Voluntary controlled population was the best <span class="underline">war
                        debt</span> the Allies could have demanded
                        
       &#8593;of the Cental Powers&#8595;
    .
                Let all peace-loving people remember that the greatest asset to militarism is the
                        <span class="underline">uncontrolled prolific</span> breeding among the
                    laboring classes. Without this, <span class="underline">militarism</span> could
                    not exist. So much for Germany.
            
            
                <h2><span class="underline">ITALY</span></h2>
                Italy became a &#8220;high pressure&#8221; zone as soon as the United States and other
                    nations raised barriers against emigration.
            
            
                <h2><span class="underline">Emigration previous to 1914:</span></h2>
                Italy had been sending into this country more than 90,000 Italians a year. As
                    soon as this was no longer possible she had to come face to face with the
                    problem of her own surplus numbers. She has had to feed, educate, and maintain
                    them, arrange for their employment in so short a time that that is why her
                    problems become suddenly so acute.
                The present territory of Italy is approximately 120,000 square miles. Only 9,000
                    square miles of this was attained thru the World War.

       &#8593;small&#8595;
     spoils of the World War. She wanted much more territory from
                    the Allies and like Japan decided to become a military force where &#8220;<span class="underline">might would make right</span>.&#8221;
            
            
                <h2>MARRIAGE</h2>
                She set herself a policy to increase her population. The age of marriage was
                    reduced from 18 years to 16 years for boys, and from 15 years to 14 years for
                    girls. 
       &#8593;Barbaric &amp; <span class="underline">Sadistic</span>&#8595;
    
                 But in spite of all provisions made for larger famillies and the medals and

                <h2>JAPAN</h2>
                The tendency on the part of all nations since the War to be self-sufficient, and
                    create their own industries, and build up walls of protective tariffs, has
                    created a world situation which <span class="underline">continues to baffle
                        statesmen</span>.
                This condition has spread to other countries like Japan. Standards of living,
                    wants and demands increase with industrial growth and education. People will
                    refuse to remain docile and starving as they awaken to educational
                    advantages.
                The choice between death, with starvation and hard work, and death from battle,
                    and a chance of better living, thru expansion, is not hard to make.
                Japanese seem destined to expand and to acquire lands for her needs.

                        employment for our increasing population..&#8221;
                1933 Prof. Nyeda, Professor of Economics
                    at Tokyo University, Institute of Pacific Relations, says
                    --
                &#8220;It is unfortunate for our country which is so thickly populated,
                        and whose inhabitants are increasing so rapidly that no suitable territory
                        lies open to which we can send a large number of emigrants, while to the
                        more thinly populated countries entrance is refused despite the fact that
                        these countries are in no danger of becoming over-populated by their own
                        people.&#8221;
                &#8220;To bottle up a growing nation, such as the Japanese, in narrow
                        islands and to refuse them to expand overseas is not only unreasonable but
                        also to court <span class="underline">danger for the world</span>, for if the
                        lack of food and other raw materials should <span class="underline">become
                            the cause</span> of suffering no one can predict a future of internal
                        and external peace.

       &#8593;by liberal statesmen in Japan&#8595;
    
                
                    (1) Reorganization of economic system
                    (2) Expansion of export industries
                    (3) Emigration to own territory
                    (4) Slow down birth rate through Birth Control and sterilization -- for
                        Culture and Peace
                
                Birth Control has made its way into Japan. It has already begun to work by later
                    marriage and small families. Experts predict that by 1945 her population will
                    become static and will not go beyond 80,000,000 -- never reach the 100,000,000
                    goal her Militarists have set for it.
                It has become clear that the population of the earth is fast arriving at its
                    possible maximum; that its density is badly distributed; that redistribution of
                    space can only be rectified by displacements; and that Birth Control in
                    over-populated countries is the first and surest method whereby the balance may
                    be peacefully restored.
                <span class="underline">Consequently</span> --
                There must be action on the part of &#8220;low pressure&#8221; nations.
            
            
                <h2 class="underline">Way Out for &#8220;Low Pressure&#8221; Nations</h2>
                For immediate action:

                        essential.
                    3. Raise tariff bars and encourage exchange of products -- Thus &#8220;Live and
                        Let Live.&#8221;
                    4. Also form a League of low birth rate countries to create cultural

                        to destroy. 
       &#8593;Germany Russia Japan &amp; Italy&#8595;
    
                    6. World Congress to set up a special University for study of Population
