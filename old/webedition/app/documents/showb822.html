        <h1>Margaret Sanger's 1954 Speech to the Japanese Diet</h1>
        <p>Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p>Interpreter: Mr. Minoru Muramatsu</p>
        <p>Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee, it is a
            matter of extreme joy as well as great pleasure for me to be invited to today&#8217;s meeting
            in which a very important subject will be discussed with all of you. The population
            problem and conception control are very important subjects to which I have devoted most
            of my life. Since I have arrived at adulthood, I have devoted myself entirely to the
            above mentioned subjects for a long period of time. The above mentioned movement in the
                United States was actually started in 1914, from a practical and
            educational standpoint. Birth control was considered a controversial subject in many
            countries. Under the present circumstances, however, it is not a particularly
            controversial subject in the United States. In 1914, the United States was not
            overpopulated and was not at a stage at which it had the possibility of overpopulation.
            However, the actual circumstances then were such that artificial abortion was extremely
            prevalent in the United States. Needless to say, it was not legal. Due to this fact, the
            exact number of artificial abortions can only be estimated as two million or more
            artificial abortions that were probably carried out in the United States in those
            days</p>
        <p>Chairman: Mr. Aiichi Kamijo</p>
        <p>May I interrupt your speech, Mrs. Sanger. Members of the committee, please understand that due
                to the limitation of time Mrs. Sanger will first discuss the circumstances of the
                population problem and conception control in the world and then questions by members
                of the committee will be answered. By the way, please entrust me with this task to
                decide whether a speech by a person who is not a member of the committee is allowed
                or not. Do you have any objection? </p>
        <p> Somebody says--No objection.</p>
        <p> Chairman: Mr. Aiichi Kamijo.</p>
        <p>
            I see. No objection. Please acknowledge that the interpreter in today&#8217;s
                meeting is Dr. Muramatsu, who is a technical official from the Ministry of Health and Welfare
                and was asked to translate due to the fact that the subject is highly technical and
                scientific. Please continue your speech, Mrs. Sanger.</p>
        <p> Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p> Interpreter: Mr. Minoru Muramatsu</p>
        <p> I am very interested in the fact that Japan is interested in the work of Planned Parenthood. It is also
            my great interest that similar to the United States in 1914 that the
            above mentioned work brought a confrontation with a large number of artificial abortions
            which created a sensation of great interest in the above mentioned field. I am now
            looking at the present circumstances in Japan and I am happy to find that
            Japan has extremely fine and cogent eugenically related laws and regulations. In the
            United States, the eugenic laws and regulations were applied to immigrants entering our
            country from foreign countries. For example, laws and regulations were enforced which
            prevented persons with bad diseases, infectious diseases, mental disorders or other
            handicaps considered disadvantageous to our country, from entering the United States.
            This was a form of eugenic protection. On the other hand, Japan has a good legal policy
            which can be enforced internally from the standpoint of eugenic protection.</p>
        <p> The United States, at the time of the starting of the above mentioned movement, met with
            extremely strong opposition. For example, Puritans and people in a similar category as
            the Puritans had moral ideas such that they rarely talked about natural instincts such
            as sex or birth control not only in public meetings but not even in private
            conversation. Such a topic of natural instinct was considered a matter of indecency.
            Opposition from the standpoint of the following reasons was prevalent in the United
            States in 1914. The laws and regulations of the federal government and each state in the United States specified that it was
            a crime for any person engaged in medicine to mail written documents, literature, graphs
            or diagrams on birth control. It was an era where efforts were made to enlighten the
            general public on the understanding of the above mentioned movement for at least ten
            years. Historically speaking, the term &#8220;birth control&#8221; is widely used at present.
            However, I can say that this terminology was practically coined by me. This terminology
            is still used at present and the term &#8220;birth control&#8221; is thought to be good terminology.
            However, the definition of this terminology is relatively difficult in practical
            application. I have made the greatest effort to make people understand the prudent and
            true meaning of this terminology. I can say that the meaning of the term &#8220;birth control&#8221;
            is the conscious control of birth by means of preventing conception. In particular, the
            point to be noticed at this time is that is must prevent the occurrence of pregnancy
            ahead of time but it must not destroy or break a phenomenon that has already occurred.
            The other point is that the word &#8220;control&#8221; is not identical to the work &#8220;limitation&#8221;
            that means restriction in the true sense of the English language. That is, the number of
            children to be born is not limited to one or two but must be determined from the
            standpoint of how many children the parents can raise by taking into consideration both
            maternal health and the father&#8217;s financial ability. We have used every effort in dealing
            with these points.</p>
        <p> The above mentioned point is the most noticeable aspect of our movement and is the first
            point to be mentioned during the execution of our work. Second, I myself was engaged in
            the field of nursing in those days and I fully realized that the entire medical world
            had to have a correct understanding of the progress of this movement. However, it took a
            relatively long time for us to lead the whole medical world sufficiently to support this
            program. For example, it took about seven years in Washington, D.C. to change the federal law to permit birth control. As a
            result of our working for birth control, our federal government eventually changed the
            laws and regulations. On that occasion, a Japanese physician who was working for a
                Tokyo hospital, made a great effort to help us in
            order to accomplish the above mentioned goal of the birth control movement. The efforts
            of the Japanese physician significantly helped us and he was a significant driving force
            who helped accomplish our goal. A contraceptive appliance, that is a pessary, was mailed
            to a physician in the United States and was brought by us to the Supreme Court. As a result, it led to the
            Supreme Court&#8217;s decision that physicians in the United States could legally prescribe
            and teach people how to use the contraceptive appliance mentioned a little while ago.
            This shows how our legislation was changed with support from a foreign country in
            1935.</p>
        <p> The number of clinics which are directly related to birth control number over five
            hundred in the United States. At the present time, all of them are operated under
            sufficient guidance of medically related persons. However, a significantly controversial
            point still exists even in the United States at the present time. As you know, we are
            people who are living in a vast land. People who live in cities are given relatively
            easy opportunity to visit the clinics mentioned. Generally speaking, due to this, people
            who visit these clinics are mainly well-educated or highly cultured persons who earn a
            relatively large income. For this reason, much of the correct knowledge on birth control
            can be conveyed to the persons mentioned above. On the other hand, a large number of
            lower class people who earn a relatively small income live on farms remote from towns
            and are agricultural people. They have some difficulties. They rarely visit the clinics
            mentioned a little while ago with the result that they cannot be given correct guidance.
            In addition, the fact is that people who live in remote areas actually need information
            on the above mentioned matters.</p>
        <p> As discussed previously, the actual knowledge cannot be conveyed to all persons who need
            the actual knowledge such as I mentioned a little while ago. I don&#8217;t know how to say
            this but the above mentioned fact may be called &#8220;negative selection&#8221; and at the meeting
            I listened to, it is a present tendency. The speech delivered by the Chairman also
            indicates that Japan has had a similar difficulty. However, I think that Japan has
            established an extremely good goal and has done an extremely good job. The work, related
            to Planned Parenthood, is executed through various facilities which are related to
            public health while they are at the same time deeply related to social welfare. An
            effort is intended to satisfy people who earn a low income and whose number is actually
            very large and urgently want the birth control. In relation to the present public health
            and welfare program, in order to overcome the above mentioned difficulty, the Ministry
            of Health and Welfare of Japan under the leadership of the Minister of Health and Welfare is very interested in the above mentioned
            effort.</p>
        <p> In addition, it is known that Dr. Koya at the Institute of Public Health has done an
            excellent job in the above mentioned matter. According to Dr. Koya&#8217;s talk on the above
            mentioned work, personnel are visiting an individual person in a farm village,
            mining-related location or fishing village in order to guide the people in the above
            mentioned matters. Dr. Koya has done extensive research on the subject of how persons
            who live in the above mentioned places respond to and to what degree they are interested
            in birth control. I was told that the present population of Japan is about 87 million in
            1954 and that the annual increase in population exceeds 1 million. This fact indicates a
            situation such that countermeasures need to be employed for limiting population growth.
            These measures need to be implemented as soon as possible in order to counterbalance
            population growth.</p>
        <p> In addition to Japan, India is another country trying to resolve a
            similar controversial problem. India, which needs birth control the most, must continue
            an effort which suppresses population growth to a rational level as soon as possible.
            Let me talk about India a little bit. India is a country which has a population which
            differs widely from our population. Due to this, the population problem is extremely
            serious in India. Sixty-six percent of the total population are said not to take a full
            meal even once a day. India suffers from an extremely serious population problem.
            However, the whole country is very interested in the above mentioned problem due to the
            fact that India has been confronted with an extremely serious situation since her
            independence. For this reason, Prime Minister Nehru strongly emphasized that a program of birth control had to be
            included in India&#8217;s Five Year Plan and he stated that the nation had to appropriate a
            relatively large amount of money in the budget in order to do a satisfactory job. As a
            result, the India government appropriated a certain amount of money in the budget, which
            is in India currency equivalent to about 1.3 million U.S. dollars. This is what I heard
            after our conference held in Bombay in 1953. The
            above mentioned budget was allotted to the fields of public health and social welfare in
            order to predominantly decrease the population and population growth in slums or regions
            in which many extremely poor people are living. At present, the project stated above is
            actually being executed.</p>
        <p> However, the above mentioned budget of India is never an extremely large amount of money
            when taking into consideration India&#8217;s serious population problem and other problems.
            Several million dollars are needed and allotted yearly to the budget for irrigation,
            rejuvenation of land and food. All of these are immediate and urgent problems with five
            million babies born this year and six million or more babies projected for next
            year.</p>
        <p> Water has been brought during the monsoon season and is used for irrigation and an
            effort has been made to rejuvenate the land. This must be increased. For example, any
            work or any effort cannot catch up with a population growth of ten to 15 million who
            will want to obtain food. The population growth is always ahead of resources. Even
            though an extremely large amount of money is spent in order to execute other projects,
            it cannot catch up to the population growth. Due to this, the country of India is
            attempting to make a great effort in order to build up a better and happy country from
            the standpoint of present knowledge, actual policy and religious practice.</p>
        <p> However, the above mentioned purpose can probably not be accomplished rapidly. It may
            take 10 years before the results can slowly be obtained at last. However, it is very
            meaningful that the population problems mentioned just now can be slightly resolved. For
            example, the number of beggars who flood the streets will be decreased, the number of
            sick persons who are not under the care of anybody will steadily decrease and the number
            of persons who do not have houses of their own to live in will be decreased. This truly
            miserable situation in which persons are born in ditches at the corner of a town and
            probably spend their entire life in the ditches and their children repeat the above
            mentioned cycle will be improved more or less. It must be concluded without reservation
            that any movement in this field can necessarily achieve great work.</p>
        <p> I, myself, am interested in Japanese art especially through my study of Japanese
            paintings. I was interested to learn that the population of Japan was at a stationary
            level for about 100 years from 1700-1800. That is, the level was not less than 33
            million and it did not significantly exceed 33 million. I also heard that the Japanese
            culture on arts exhibited significant progress during the era mentioned just now from
            the standpoint of the arts. At present, all of you are enjoying those great artists and
            are spending your daily life with beautiful memories of various things from that era.
            However, Japan has made significant progress with industrialization since the Meiji
            Restoration and yet at the same time, Japan suffered from a significant population
            increase.</p>
        <p> When I visited Japan previously in 1922 {in the 11th year of Taisho} the population of
            Japan was about 60 million. However, the population of Japan is 87 million at the
            present time. The population growth has been very rapid during the above mentioned time
            period. As discussed by the Chairman, previously, Japan has increased in population and
            has undergone further decline in its territory which can produce food, as compared with
            the past, when Japan had to support a population of 60 million. Due to this, the
            population growth of Japan is an extremely serious problem. Although the above mentioned
            problem is serious, it can be resolved.</p>
        <p> In conclusion, I would like to say a word and make some concluding remarks. I am
            expecting questions and answers from you later. As discussed earlier, overpopulation is
            a problem which is not only confronting Japan but almost all countries of the world in
            some degree, though the degree of overpopulation differs between each country.
            Currently, the United States does not significantly suffer from the problem of
            overpopulation. However, the situation is thought to be such that the United States may
            be confronted with this in the near future. At the same time, such European countries as
                Germany, Italy and Great Britain are
            now confronting a serious problem which is similar to that of the other countries
            mentioned a little while ago. Two countries such as India and Japan are attempting to
            resolve the population growth in an extremely practical way and are actually executing a
            method which can directly resolve the population problem. I am thinking that the above
            mentioned point is most important at the present time.</p>
        <p> Many of you may know the name of Edward
            Ackerman. When Edward Ackerman, a famous scholar, once visited Japan he did an
            investigation on natural resources for 2 years and then returned to the United States.
            The conclusion of his report can be summarized by the following statements. Japan has
            three choices for the future. The first is to decrease the birth rate by the
            self-conscious and constructive use of a natural and reasonable method, that is, the
            birth rate must be decreased by birth control in order to prepare for the future
            situation. The second choice for Japan is to rely permanently on other countries such as
            the United States for food. The third choice is that food or the necessities of life
            provided for each individual are reduced, that is, each individual cannot always work on
            a full stomach and each individual will always live in an unsatisfactory condition.</p>
        <p> Edward Ackerman concluded that the choice that was mentioned lastly in which the quota
            for each individual is cut is necessarily intolerable for intellectual vigorous and
            lively peoples. It can be thought that each individual will reasonably and vigorously
            adopt an extremely antisocial action such as carrying out a revolution in order for
            himself or herself to obtain more to survive. The second choice is also intolerable in
            which one country must rely on another country for food and such important necessities
            of life. This would be difficult for a proud and self-respecting people. For this
            reason, the choice left is the first choice of he harmony of the birth rate with the
            death rate. The population of Japan is predicted to reach 100 million in the very near
            future. The Japanese must independently plan a countermeasure for the above mentioned
            situation as soon as possible. That is, the most intelligent way left is the first
            choice.</p>
        <p> I would like to speak a word or make a remark on the recent extremely rapid progress in
            the practical methods in the field of birth control. The present technical and practical
            methods exhibit many drawbacks such that they are not simple, inexpensive or safe. An
            extremely large number of people all over the world want a practical birth control
            method. Various practical methods are extremely difficult to use. However, many scholars
            have been conducting research on the practical methods in the United Sates for the last
            7 years and have been making a great effort to develop a method for birth control which
            is very simple, inexpensive and safe. For example, the human egg could become immune
            against pregnancy. As you know, cholera and smallpox can be prevented by a preventive
            injection. Why is there not the same preventive method applicable to an immunity against
            pregnancy? There is no reason why immunity against pregnancy cannot be accomplished.
            Needless to say, it takes a relatively long time in the medical world for a new
            invention or discovery to be considered safe. In particular, a new invention or
            discovery must be tested until it is found to be safe and it must be ascertained safe
            for mankind. It is generally expected that it probably takes only a year or more to
            develop a sure, definite, simple, inexpensive and safe method for birth control. The
            united efforts of people from Japan, Great Britain, the United States, India,
                Puerto Rico and other countries are attempting to resolve the above
            mentioned problem.</p>
        <p> The purpose of my visit to Japan at this time includes that I should truly like to
            discuss the above mentioned subject with persons who are conducting research in the
            above mentioned fields. Unfortunately, I do not speak Japanese so that I cannot
            communicate directly with you. Finally, I offer all of you my heartfelt thanks for your
            listening to my speech and by taking precious time from your busy work. {Hand clapping
            from audience}</p>
        <p> Chairman: Mr. Aiichi Kamijo </p>
        <p>
            Do you have any questions?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Fuku Yokoyama</p>
        <p>May I ask you a question? Unfortunately, I could not meet you {Mrs.
                Sanger} during your last visit to Japan in 1952. However, I listened to Dr. Stone&#8217;s talk about a drug which acts on a
                spermatozoon or ovum in order to forfeit the generative function. This drug was
                being developed as an oral medicine. I read a newspaper article in which during your
                visit to Japan at this time that you will recommend the above mentioned drug to the
                    Ministry of Health and
                    Welfare due to the fact the research on the above mentioned drug has been
                completed. I heard during your last visit that the above mentioned drug could
                exhibit its effect over a relatively long time after it had been taken internally
                and in addition, the term of validity of the above mentioned drug is short. I want
                to know the stage of the research on the above mentioned drug.</p>
        <p>Witness: Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p> Interpreter: Mr. Minoru Muramatsu</p>
        <p> My answer is not directly related to your question. As you mentioned earlier, I remember
            that Dr. Stone talked briefly about drugs which were still at the experimental stage at
            that time of her visit to Japan two years ago in 1952. For example, one method is an
            extremely simple method such as the employment of an oil which is not taken orally.
            There is a person named Dr. Clarence Gamble in
            India who is conducting intensive research on an ordinary oil which is not a medicine
            used for internal use but which is used locally like a tampon in its external
            appearance. In addition, the research on the extraction and injection of the above
            mentioned oil is in progress. At present, however, as discussed earlier, they are still
            in the experimental stage. Extensive research is still necessary in the future.</p>
        <p> Ms. Fuku Yokoyama</p>
        <p> I heard that the Sanger
                    Clinic of the United States exhibits significant progress in practical
                guidance. When we are attempting to instruct on practical methods, we have some
                difficulty in practical guidance. It would be a great thing if you could tell me the
                actual situation of the Sanger Clinic in detail.</p>
        <p> Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p> Interpreter: Mr. Minoru Muramatsu</p>
        <p> As you said, the practical method or procedure recently exhibits a significant increase
            in the percentage of success in the United States. The percentage of success if said to
            be about 98.9%. The most important point of the operation of a practical clinic is such
            that physicians in charge must be persons who have been trained professionally in the
            field. Unfortunately, the education of the average physician and the curricula of
            medical schools in the United States in particular do not include courses on detailed
            conception control. Due to this, physician who engage in the above mentioned field must
            be adequately trained under the sufficient supervision of Dr. Stone or others and then
            have experience working as professionals in the Sanger Clinic. The ability of a
            physician in charge is the first priority due to the following reason. In the clinic
            mentioned just now, it is very important that a physician work under the condition that
            not only he or she gives simple instructions of a method verbally but also he or she
            must grasp what a women is actually seeking in order to establish an atmosphere such
            that the women understands everything completely and can do everything skillfully by
            herself. In a usual case, the physician must examine a woman who has visited a clinic
            for the first time two days after her first visit and must not leave her alone
            afterwards but follow her condition. This procedure has been very successful. The
            physician&#8217;s ability is extremely important from the standpoint that he or she must
            &#8220;guide&#8221; a woman herself to be able to become skillful in a method and be able to do
            everything by herself.</p>
        <p> Ms. Fuku Yokoyama</p>
        <p>What are the technical problems and the most frequently used birth control
                methods? By the way, concerning the financial condition and income and expenditure
                of the Sanger Clinic, could you please tell us if it is supported by government
                support or public or private contributions?</p>
        <p>Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p> Interpreter: Mr. Minora Muramatsu</p>
        <p> First, I should like to say that the federal government has not related to our project.
            At least, we have not asked for any financial support at all. There are contributions
            from the usual foundations and the women who actually visit our clinic pay a certain
            amount of money for the instructions and materials both of which she has received while
            a physician in charge takes time off from a portion of his or her busy work. Educational
            information materials are usually free for all.</p>
        <p> The practical methods of our clinic are usually to provide a pessary and jelly which is
            used to lubricate the pessary for women who visit our clinic. This provides a double
            protection of mechanical and scientific procedure. The percentage of success is
            extremely high due to the double protection. However, the above mentioned method is
            surely expensive and it cannot be paid for by an extremely poor person. The principle is
            such that an amount of money is charged which is adequate for an income of a woman who
            visits our clinic or adequate to the family income of the woman. Due to this, the
            guidance and birth control materials are provided free in the case of a woman who cannot
            pay for anything.</p>
        <p> Ms. Fuku Yokoyama</p>
        <p>
            We have trouble charging a fee in the case of practical guidance. The fee
                corresponding to income can be broadly interpreted. We would be very happy if you
                can provide any available references and documents on this matter. If you don&#8217;t
                mind, please give us various printed reports available from the Sanger Clinic. As
                you discussed the matter earlier, the difficulty in the United States is exactly
                identical to the difficulty in Japan in the case of instruction. We have trouble in
                the guidance of how we can appeal to the poor classes and how we can appeal to
                people in the farm and mountain villages. How do you appeal to the public after you
                have had the same difficulty? Or alternatively, the Sanger Clinic, even as the
                nucleus, has never actually done such work due to the fact that overpopulation is
                not a serious problem in the United States. Could you please tell us how to appeal
                to the public? We would appreciate your suggestions though the degree of
                overpopulation in the United States differs from the degree of overpopulation of
                Japan.</p>
        <p> Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p> Interpreter: Mr. Minoru Muramatsu</p>
        <p> Your present question is very valuable to us due to the following reason. The facts
            which you have just pointed out are a significant weak point in the birth control
            movement conducted by us in the United States. That is, our influence on people in the
            lowest social stratum is not satisfactory in practical cases. This is due to strong
            religious and political opposition. To be frank with you, the so called &#8220;McCarthyism&#8221; flames in the United States at the
            present time. I should like to make a remark on the extremely strong opposition from the
            above mentioned quarters. On the other hand, as you mentioned a little while ago, Japan
            has been making a great effort in which persons in charge of public health and welfare
            are attempting to execute a work of nondiscriminatory availability. Although, public
            institutions are extremely actively influencing the improvement of all sick persons or
            people in the lowest social stratum for miserable conditions and undernourishment, the
            public organizations of the United States have usually been opposed to birth control. I
            feel that Japan has made more progress from the above mentioned standpoint.</p>
        <p> Ms. Fuku Yokoyama</p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your lengthy discussion and many suggestions. Since I do
                not understand English, I regret to say that I feel slightly annoyed that something
                cannot be done as hoped so that I cannot ask any exact questions. Could you please
                provide me with assistance if I visit the United States some day in the future to
                make an on-site inspection. I am asking you for the above mentioned assistance at
                this lucky opportunity and I should like to ask for other assistance. The
                governmental fund is not given to us at all in Japan due to the fact that the
                national financial situation has been bad since World War II. Donations from
                foundations cannot be expected, unlike in the United States. The population problem
                of Japan is an extremely gangrenous evil and the past World War II is thought to be
                partially caused by the above mentioned evil. Please, understand the existing state
                of national affairs, Mrs. Sanger. Since Mrs. Sanger has specially visited Japan, I
                would like to ask Mrs. Sanger for any possible support and advice in all phases in
                order to accomplish the effective progress of birth control in Japan despite many
                difficulties. Now, I want to end the lenghty questioning after I ask Mrs. Sanger to
                give us support for all phases concerning the population problems in Japan. Thank
                you very much, Mrs. Sanger for your participation, even though you are
            tired.</p>
        <p> Chairman: Mr. Aiichi Kamijo</p>
        <p>
            I have a favor to ask all of the members of the committee. Members of the
                committee can have personal conversations with Mrs. Sanger later so that you can
                have an opportunity to talk to Mrs. Sanger at that time. Please, now ask only one
                question briefly for each person due to the time limit.</p>
        <p> Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p> Interpreter: Mr. Minoru Muramatsu</p>
        <p> I entirely agree with your opinion, Mrs. Fuku Yokoyama. Please, visit my country by all
            means if you have the opportunity in the future. Please make observations of the actual
            circumstances in the clinic. At the same time, I hope with my whole heart that I can
            probably bring news of a simple good, inexpensive and safe birth control drug to you in
            a few years.</p>
        <p> I will now tell you a funny story though I will agree it may be beside the point. It has
            been known for a long time that the birth rate of North American Indians is low. As you
            know, American Indian people are always angry because of their ill treatment by the
            United States government with respect to bearing children. For this reason they are
            thought to have decided not to execute decreasing their birth rate under the control of
            the US government. Actually, their birth rate is extremely low. There are many tribes of
            North American Indians and the birth rate of all of the tribes is low. It was very
            interesting that we learned from the North American Indians about two years ago the
            reason why. The reason that the birth rate of the North American Indians is low is that
            the American Indians drink tea which is made from herbs which are grown in the desert.
            It was discovered that the drinking of the above mentioned tea could accomplish the
            purpose of conception control. This story is a simple, funny story. It is thought that
            people will go to a country in which tea is loved and then drink tea ravenously so that
            their birthrate can decline in the near future.</p>
        <p> Mr. Kazuo Takao</p>
        <p>
            I should like to ask you a simple question, Mrs. Sanger, through the
                interpreter. There are many methods of birth control in which an appliance or drug
                is used in both the US and Japan. However, there may be a big difference in the
                contraceptive effect of these methods between the United States and Japan. In the
                United States, the people live in Western-style houses. (The Japanese house is not
                built to preserve privacy.) In Japan, the house and rooms are of Japanese style even
                though the same birth control methods are employed. According to the interpretation
                by the interpreter a little while ago, the percentage of success with birth control
                methods in the US is said to be 98%. Is the percentage of success 98% applicable to
                a specific method or is it the overall statistical average of all methods? Suppose
                the 98% success rate is the overall average, what percent are successful among 100
                birth control users? In addition, when 100 couples execute birth control, what
                percent are successful? Though the above mentioned statistics are available a little
                bit in Japan, please inform us of the above mentioned statistics in the US?</p>
        <p> Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p> Interpreter: Mr. Minoru Muramatsu</p>
        <p> The 98% success rate mentioned a little while ago means that 98% success rate for women
            who visit our clinic and employ the joint use of a pessary with a jelly. That is, it
            means that 98% of the subjects are successful according to the above mentioned methods.
            Many of the women cannot use a pessary and jelly because of their physical condition.
            For example, a woman who suffers from a prolapsed uterus cannot use a pessary even
            though she wants to use one. Due to this, some women are obliged to use another method
            such as a cap for the cervix or use a jelly only in which the percentage of success is
            slightly lower than the 98% success rate mentioned a little while ago. I have mentioned
            that our clinical experience with the success rate for the joint use of a pessary and
            jelly with normal women is 98%.</p>
        <p> Concerning the evaluation by statistical percentage of success as to the second
            question, a certain foundation gave us financial support in the past so that we could
            collect statistics for our clinic on 10,000 patients. This project was done a relatively
            long time ago so that in a large number of cases physicians in charge were not well
            trained so that they had to be retrained over and above their own medical education in
            order to conduct the above mentioned work. For this reason, the percentage of success
            was less than 98%. Many clinics in the United States are sending their reports to our
            headquarters in New York City day and night. Please refer to the reports carefully in
            order to understand the percentage of success at present. We will gladly send the
            reports to you. </p>
        <p> Mr. Ichiro Tsuneoka</p>
        <p>
            I agree entirely with the birth control movement and I wish to express my
                deep indebtedness to Mrs. Sanger for her great efforts in the birth control
                movement. Due to the fact that I am living in Japan at a time when a large number of
                people are packed into a small territory at present. However, there is something I
                should like to ask you. Let us consider natural forces. For example, let us consider
                the centripetal force and the centrifugal force of the earth with the centripetal
                force and centrifugal force of the sun at the center. That is the exact opposite
                forces are admirable in harmony with each other so that the earth and sun are
                correctly in their orbits without any tracks. Let us think of the providence of the
                universe. Or alternatively, let us think of the problem of a life such that we are
                born with two eyes and two ears without our wish or exerting ourselves. The natural
                activity and universal truth both of which can control or regulate our universe.
                This antipodal phenomena may exist in this universe by taking into consideration the
                facts mentioned a little while ago. Religious people in the world believe in God may
                offer opposition to the ideas of the birth control movement. Do you ever have any
                trouble with respect to the opposition of these ideas or do you not believe in
                divine Providence so that the birth control movement in which man must control
                something is much superior to divine Providence? Please answer these questions
                first. I should like to ask whether you have any trouble with strong counterattacks
                or strong criticism from men of religion?</p>
        <p> Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p> Interpreter: Mr. Minoru Muramatsu</p>
        <p> We have had very strong opposition to the movement at the initial stage in the United
            States from the standpoint of religious opposition which you pointed out just now. It
            was an extremely unforgettably important problem to us. People in the field of religion
            are essentially thinking that God provides a life for man, that is, God provides food,
            clothing and shelter necessary for a life. Although, there are a lot of people who are
            not well fed, well clothed or well housed in the United States even at the present time,
            there is a lot of religious opposition at present under circumstances mentioned just
            now. We are always fighting against this opposition. I think that God has given us
            intelligence and that God has given us the freedom of thought and thinking so that
            mankind is ranked higher than the usual animals and is ranked much higher than simple
            animals. Mankind is responsible to utilize this intelligence sufficiently which has been
            given to human beings by God. In other words, God who has given us intelligence as human
            beings is not cruel enough to admit a new life who cannot be taken care of responsibly.
            I cannot express my thoughts in words on this to my satisfaction. However, I have given
            a rough explanation of my views.</p>
        <p> Mr. Ichiro Tsuneoka</p>
        <p>
            I should like to ask a question. For example, there is a tribe named the
                Ainu race in Japan just like you talked about the North American Indians, who have
                somehow attempted to be preserved as a species and to be prosperous. However, the
                Ainu race is not proliferating. Their population decrease is not due in particular
                to high intelligence. It is strange that people do not proliferate even though they
                have attempted to proliferate. This phenomenon may be one of natural
            control.</p>
        <p> In a certain country, the population is intended to increase. However, it is decreasing
            little by little. For example, France is decreasing. If people all over
            the world disregard any idea of holding their own ground as a small country but conduct
            a campaign for delivering all natural resources of the world to all mankind, it is
            rather a shortsighted policy that birth control is one of the methods human beings can
            apply to a race who is still prospering. This is my question. How about this?</p>
        <p> In addition to the fact mentioned a little while ago, birth control was very prevalent
            in strong and barren lands such as the old province of Tosa and the present prefecture
            of Kagoshima even in Japan, during the feudal age. However, when Japan became on
            economic unit or one national economic unit as a result of the destruction of feudalism,
            the old province of Tosa and the present prefecture of Kagoshima could support many
            people due to the fact that broad areas were then opened up for the Japanese people. I
            think that it may be the intelligence given by God that the whole world must work
            together and extend a helping hand to newborn babies. An idea which suppresses the
            growing ability of people who live in a small land is unfair unless those people are
            released into a larger place. What do you think of my opinion?</p>
        <p> Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p> Interpreter: Mr. Minoru Muramatsu</p>
        <p> I am doubtful whether I can appropriately answer the question or not. I think there are
            persons who can answer more appropriately. I should like to say that there is as you
            know an organization called the United Nations. The United Nations is making
            an effort to unite the world under the condition that countries which in principle have
            the same opinion gather together. However, the actual circumstances are such that all
            the countries in the world have not joined the United Nations. The philosophical or
            metaphysical idea which was discussed by you just now can be applicable to the case of
            thinking of ourselves and our children under the circumstances which were mentioned a
            little while ago.</p>
        <p> However, Mexico and Italy, for example are under extremely
            miserable conditions at present. The course of each country is difficult due to the
            existence of a religion, I venture to say that is a superstition. When I see these
            people directly, it is as if they were in the dark ages. I cannot respect such a
            country. Rather, I would like to respect people who are thinking clearly and are
            conscious of the happiness of human beings which can be accomplished by the application
            of modern knowledge, understanding and scientific methods which we have acquired at
            present. Above all, it is most important that we bring into the world new human beings
            whom we ourselves can take care of by taking into consideration our knowledge and
            responsibility to this world. We must avoid as much as possible placing a newborn child
            in a garden of other people for other people to take care of it. I think that the true
            parents must raise their own children as satisfactorally as possible by giving their
            affection. </p>
        <p> Mr. Hisatado Hirose</p>
        <p>First, I wish to thank Mrs. Sanger, as a world authority, for her
                encouragement and for her great impression with today&#8217;s speech to which I have
                listened. I was deeply impressed in particular with several points in her speech.
                May I ask you to tell us more details regarding two points.</p>
        <p>One, is that I think that the population problem of Japan is a most
                difficult subject for the future. However, Mrs. Sanger told us that the population
                problem of Japan is most serious but it is a problem to be resolved. I was greatly
                encouraged with this point. As mentioned by Mrs. Sanger earlier, although the
                population of Japan was almost fixed in the Tokugawa era, it has gradually grown in
                the Meiji era but it could be supported by natural resources in some way before
                World War II. However, Japan has been extremely overpopulated since World War II.
                How should we deal with this population problem which is essentially a problem of
                each field of Japanese politics, economy and society? How do we resolve this problem
                which is deeply related to a political movement, and ideology of society and various
                social problems. Any person who is now engaging in Japanese politics and who is now
                engaging in social work or who is a physician should be very interested in this
                problem. Mrs. Sanger ventured to say that this problem is difficult but it can be
                resolved. I feel extremely encouraged by her speech. I am impressed with the fact
                that Mrs. Sanger, who has many experiences with the population problem, has clearly
                expressed her thoughts. I would be very happy if you could give us an extremely
                rough outline of the resolution of the population problem of Japan from your point
                of view, even though you cannot tell us every point here. What point should a
                politician always bear in mind? What should a social worker bear in mind? What
                should a physician or other who is related to public health bear in mind? Please
                give us a rough explanation.</p>
        <p>Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p>Interpreter: Mr. Minora Muramatsu</p>
        <p> You told me that I am an expert in the field of population problems. However, I feel
            that I am well behind recent advances in the field. Rather, I am a pioneer. That is, I
            mean that I am a pioneer in the sense that I was the first person who pushed the button
            in order to turn on an electric light. Scholars in this field vary extensively at
            present and must obtain comprehensive knowledge and cooperation from many physicians,
            social workers and other scholars specializing in population problems and from many
            experts who are specializing in biology and other fields.</p>
        <p>First, I would like to say that above all, the most important and most serious thing is
            the quality of a newborn&#8217;s life. As you know, there is a sterilization procedure in
            which a baby cannot be born and which is extremely cruel and violent at a glance.
            However, sterilization is a kind method after all in the long run from a broader
            perspective. It is an extremely important problem that persons who have an inferior
            inherited character cannot bear a child from the standpoint of the quality of the
            newborn population and from the standpoint of the quality of the population in the next
            generation. Recently, physicians and sociologists have become extremely interested in
            the problem which was discussed a little while ago.</p>
        <p>Please, make all possible efforts to assist in the undertaking of public health and
            welfare, all of you who are working on the floor of this great national assembly at the
            expense of other undertakings. Please provide material and spiritual facilities in which
            able persons who are related to the undertakings mentioned a little while ago can
            sufficiently display their abilities. There are many poor people who need assistance
            from the field of social work. Many people can do excellent work according to your
            efforts. People who are actively in the front lines can do better jobs. I hope that this
            day arrives as soon as possible. For this reason, all of you who are working as
            representatives of a nation on the floor of a national assembly should make the greatest
            efforts as politicians and qualified persons for the country of Japan in order to
            arrange a material and moral condition under which actual persons in charge can fully
            work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hisatado Hirose</p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Sanger&#8217;s very suggestive speech a little while ago is extremely
                sensible. I have been working for social services for a long time and I have been
                thinking that we must somehow give sufficient financial assistance to the field of
                social work. I am very regretful that Japan is extremely poor in the field of social
                work. We, as politicians, are trying to make a great effort. I am deeply grateful to
                Mrs. Sanger for her extreme encouragement in the field of social work by her visit
                to Japan.</p>
        <p>
            I should like to ask another question even though Mrs. Sanger seems to be
                tired. Mrs. Sanger praised the Planned Parenthood organization of Japan a little
                while ago. I, myself, think that the plan in which parenthood is planned is truly
                good enough. Concerning this movement, Dr. Koya, as a central figure, has been
                conducting research for several years. Please give us advice after reviewing this
                movement.</p>
        <p>
            I think that the population problem in Japan is extremely serious and I
                am very anxious that family planning or &#8220;planned parenthood&#8221; is extremely slow.
                However, I am thinking that it is natural that Japan herself must implement a
                program of planning families to help alleviate the population problem in order to
                ask the world to accept Japanese immigrants. I am truly thinking of actively
                promoting a &#8220;planned parenthood&#8221; program. Mrs. Sanger praised the Planned Parenthood
                movement in Japan. Please tell us your opinion as to which points we should support
                intensively.</p>
        <p>Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p>Interpreter: Mr. Minora Muramatsu</p>
        <p>I am very grateful for your praise for my previous speech. The purpose of my visit at
            this time is to communicate with Japanese physicians and scholars and to discuss how to
            decrease the birth rate as soon as possible, if necessary. My visit was intended to
            examine the possibility of a decline in the birth rate. It is very urgent at present
            that this program must be completed in such a short period as two years though it had to
            be completed in ten years in the past. In any case, I will work with Japanese physicians
            and Japanese scientists in other fields. I am expecting to hear joyful news from you of
            significant progress during my next visit in the near future.</p>
        <p>Diet Member (not a member of the committee): Mrs. Shizue Kato</p>
        <p>Please allow me to speak as a nonmember of the committee. I am deeply
                grateful to the Chairman and other members of the committee for their invitation of
                Mrs. Sanger to speak to the committee on Public Welfare and for their enthusiastic
                questions. I am also deeply grateful to the Chairman for his assistance. In
                conclusion, I would like to ask Mrs. Sanger a question.
        </p>
        <p>Mrs. Sanger is always saying that overpopulation is the cause for wars
                historically. It is said that nature has killed a lot of people by big earthquakes,
                floods and famines in order to resolve overpopulation by one effort. Earthquakes,
                floods and famines are said to be useful to decrease the population. Concerning
                these points, the Japanese people were recently shocked by the hydrogen bomb
                experiment by the United States. What kind of public opinion did the people in the
                United States issue with respect to the horrible reality in which the hydrogen bomb
                was used to kill a lot of the population? I would like to ask this question of Mrs.
                Sanger.</p>
        <p>Witness: Mrs. Margaret Sanger</p>
        <p> Interpreter: Mr. Minora Muramatsu</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kato is also one of the pioneers in the field and she is well known in countries all
            over the world in which birth control programs are executed. I have had many questions
            from the Japanese people as to why the American citizens did not protest against the use
            of the hydrogen bomb as an experiment.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, for example, England issued a very righteous protest
            through Parliament. Why didn&#8217;t the American citizens protest? Surely, England has the
            right to know what will happen in the future. In particular, England is an island
            country. Taking into consideration the fact that England is a country in danger in which
            the entire islands can be blown away by a momentary explosion. I think that England&#8217;s
            protest is not simply because of the danger of a hydrogen bomb but she is thinking what
            she has to do to protect her survival.</p>
        <p>There are many protest in the United States similar to the protest mentioned in England.
            However, these protests do not appear in newspaper headlines. As you know, the United
            Sates is a large country. For example, there have been protests by several people in
                Arizona where I am living but this does not influence people in
                New York. It takes a long time before national public opinion of
            protest can influence the government of the United States. You, foreigners, do not
            understand this point. In reality, some Americans are righteously protesting like
            England is doing. A lot of people have the same opinion.</p>
        <p>Chairman: Mr. Aiichi Kamijo</p>
        <p>Although, you may have more questions, the investigation on this subject
                is over due to the time. Objections?</p>
        <p>Somebody says--No objection.</p>
        <p>Chairman--Mr. Aiichi Kamijo</p>
        <p> I see. No objections. I am deeply grateful to Mrs. Sanger for her
                extremely useful presentation and her answers to the questions. I wish to express my
                deep indebtedness to Mrs. Sanger at the closing moments of the committee meeting. We
                are making efforts to establish counter measures against the population problem and
                to support birth control by referring to the valuable information given to
            us.</p>
        <p>Finally, I wish to express my deepest gratitude to Mrs. Sanger and Dr.
                Muramatsu for his clear interpretation for such a long period of time.
                (Handclapping) Now, let&#8217;s close today&#8217;s meeting of the committee.</p>
        <p>Adjournment: 4:41 p.m. </p>
