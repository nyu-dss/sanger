        <h1>HAZLETON STRIKERS REPUDIATE A.F. OF L.</h1>
        <h2>(Special to Solidarity.)</h2>
        Hazleton, Pa., April 15.
        <p>The strike of the Duplan Silk Workers, at Hazleton, Pa., is still on, in spite of the
            fact that Mrs. Sarah Conboy, general organizer for the United
                Textile Workers of America, tried to break the strike by drawing up a contract
            in which the mill bosses agreed to give the strikers a raise of from 5 to 10 cents a
            week.</p>
        <p>Evidently their generosity became painful to them, and they injected a clause whereby
            even this "slap in the face" raise could be taken from them at the
            discretion of the bosses. Most of the workers are little boys and girls who range in age
            from 14 to 18 years. This is their first strike, and they all claim that they have
            learned more in seven weeks on strike, than their fathers or mothers learned in ten
            years.</p>
        <p>When running full force there are about 1,200 workers in the mill, and to date there are
            about 300 back to work.</p>
        <p>The papers, as usual, lie and slander the I.W.W. The church, with all its influence, preaches in the pulpit against the
            organization, using its influence to send the boys and girls who have stood out for nine
            weeks firmly against the boss, back to work for a few cents' raise a week. The contract
            signed by Mrs. Conboy and her A. F. of L. organization speaks for itself as a cowardly,
            dastardly, sell out.</p>
        <p>Everything was going to be in readiness last Monday to resume work. The boys and girls
            requested Elizabeth Gurley Flynn to come and explain the signed
            contract to those who live so far away that they cannot attend the daily meetings. The
            Family Theatre was packed to the doors and a lively and enthusiastic meeting
            resulted.</p>
        <p>When some of the opposition pushed their way into the hall and asked to be heard, it was
            all that Louis Gergotz, the chairman, could do to get the floor for
            them. He plead with the boys and girls to give them a hearing. That they were there only
            to break up the meeting was evident, for insult after insult was thrown at the I. W. W.
            speakers, which only incited the wrath of the audience. The trick was to break up the
            meeting, arrest the speakers and intimidate the workers so that they would all return to
            work Monday, the following day. The trick failed.</p>
        <p>Another meeting was held that night for the parents, many of whom are miners; and the
            Italians, where E. G. Flynn and Carlo Tresca again spoke.</p>
        <p>On Monday morning there were almost 5,000 pickets and sympathizers around the mill. The
            whole force of mill bosses, political bosses, and heelers joined forces with Mrs. Conboy
            at the mill gates, begging the workers to return "where you belong"
            as Mrs. Conboy said.</p>
        <p>The youngsters snapped their fingers in their faces and proceeded to another big meeting
            in which they declared the strike was still on, and they would remain out until their
            demands were granted.</p>
        <p>The next day the police began their dirty work of arresting crowds of pickets for
                "loitering," which means when the police tell you to
                "stop" you are arrested for "loitering."
            Twenty-six of us altogether were arrested in one day. Very few fines were paid; all
            agreed we would pay not a cent in fines.</p>
        <p>The political boss, McKelvey, holds several
            positions in Hazleton. At 7 A.M. he's at the mill gate in the capacity of a county
            detective, who may arrest anyone. At 9 o'clock you may be confronted with Mr. McKelvey
            in the capacity of alderman, acting as judge to sentence the one previously
            arrested.</p>
        <p>The last card is being played Monday next, when John Golden has been
            invited to explain the contract to those I.W.W. and A. F. of L. silk workers, not
            allowing I.W.W. organizers within the hall. The boys and girls wired Big Bill Haywood to come and hold a meeting the
            same night and explain the contract, and invite everyone--including John Golden. </p>
        <p>The little town is all excitement. The strike has been a wonderful eyeopener to all
            workers, including the miners. Some of the mine locals have promised to stop work and go
            on picket duty with the boys and girls next Monday.</p>
        <p>Keep your eye on Hazleton, fellow workers, and watch results.</p>
