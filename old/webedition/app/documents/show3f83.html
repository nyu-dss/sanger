        <p>Many of you must feel like I do each morning as I read the daily
            paper, and ask yourselves, &#8220;Will we ever again have Peace in
                Europe or the World?&#8221;</p>
        <p>As we have witnessed during the past few years nation after nation
            become subdued and humiliated, controlled and dominated, by
            aggressor nations while friendly nations of the democracies stand by
            helpless and afraid.</p>
        <p>What has happened that these conditions exist and can continue to
            exist? My own answer to this question is that the men and women now
            living who took part in the World War have lost faith in the
            promises of the democracies. We are all bewildered, confused and
            skeptical.</p>
        <p>The one consolation for this position is that people are at last
            seriously trying to find out the cause of wars and if this can be
            discovered we can look hopefully to an end of wars. </p>
        <p>There is one fundamental cause of present wars. The pressure of
            population in a given country to its means of existence.
                Germany and Italy and
                Japan are overcrowded countries. They need room
            for expansion. They need more land for food. They need tillable
            productive land. They need natural resources with iron, oil,
            minerals and other necessities for manufacturing and they need
            markets in which they can sell and exchange their goods for food
            which they cannot grow but must purchase to exist. </p>
        <p>Briefly, this is one of the chief causes of the present conflict in
            Europe and Asia today. Population problems are
            various and increasingly complex. But unless statesmen tackle and
            solve these problems they will continue to increase beyond solution. </p>
        <p>Germany and Italy are calling for colonies and more land while at the
            same time they offer prizes to their people to bring more children
            into the already overcrowded country to increase their numbers. </p>
        <p>&#8220;Our babies are starving. Give us more babies,&#8221; is
            the absurd cry of the militaristic nations. </p>
        <p>There has been a general belief in this and other countries that a
            large population is the sign of prosperity and advanced
            civilization. Because of this opinion we are told that small
            families will mean extinction of the race. </p>
        <p>Never has there been greater need of careful accurate thinking than
            today concerning this question of population, the birth rate and
            birth control. </p>
        <p>We are witnessing today in Europe and Asia a condition of war and
            expansion for territory, colonies and markets which means that the
            population of Italy, Germany and Japan have outgrown the territory
            upon which their numbers can subsist.</p>
        <p>There are three conditions in which nations find themselves when its
            populations gets beyond its capacity to support itself -</p>
        <p><span class="underline">1st</span> They can colonize like
                England, France and other
            countries did in the early 18th century before new countries were
            crowded. </p>
        <p><span class="underline">2nd</span> They can lower their standards of
            living, like India, China and Islands
            like Puerto Rico. </p>
        <p><span class="underline">3rd</span> They can control their birth rate
            like the Scandinavian countries and adjust their increasing numbers
            to their ability to feed, clothe and educate their population. These
            small nations, Sweden, Norway and
                Denmark do not colonize, do not own land outside
            their own border, yet have a high civilization, with health and
            educational facilities which have become models for the rest of the
            world. These are peaceful nations whose people prefer culture,
            intelligence and peace to disorder.</p>
        <p>The almost universal custom in discussing population decrease is to
            deplore a decreasing birth rate. This is a sad commentary on sound
            thinking. </p>
        <p>There may be fewer children born in a family or city or country while
            the numbers as a whole 
       &#8593;may&#8595;
     increase. This is caused by a
            decreasing death rate and longer lives of more people. In other
            words, to keep those babies now born alive, to keep the mothers
            alive and healthy, to give the father a chance and opportunity to
            keep his head above water and 
       &#8593;to&#8595;
     provide for his family
            means not only a growing population, but a healthier and happier
            people who will want Peace and Education and Happiness. </p>
        <p>If each nation will keep its birth rate under control, fears and
            needs for wars will become extinct relics of a barbarous age. </p>
        <p>You have here in Tucson a Birth Control Clinic where mothers may go for safe
            harmless information as to the way to space the babies and avoid
            conditions of pregnancy. Every child has the right to be wanted and
            every mother has the right to safeguard her health and life to enjoy
            motherhood and live to see them grow into manhood and womanhood. </p>
        <p>No subject is closer to the hearts of men and women, especially
            parents, than that of Peace. Just what can be done by us to see that
            Peace in the world can be maintained, not only for ourselves but for
            our children, should be the greatest question before us today. </p>
        <p>Since the end of the World War twenty years ago there has been
            applied various known theories of the political and social sciences
            to keep peace in Europe, but all have failed. Wars may not be caused
            by any particular one factor, but no one can deny that too many
            people crowded into territory too small for maintenance either leads
            to a depleted inert condition of the people, such as in Puerto Rico
            under our own forty year rule -- or in China and India. </p>
