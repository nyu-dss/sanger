                Washington, DC home of Louise
                Chase Myers, to an audience of 150 people. Interlineations and deletions by

        <p> I cannot express too firmly my conviction that this is the way to national suicide,
            politically, physically, and economically. The vote of the moron has the same numerical
            significance as that of the college graduate. A nation drawing the largest portion of
            its population from the strata living at subsistence level cannot produce the
                    
       &#8593;<span class="del">citizens with</span> the&#8595;
     stamina, initiative, and vigorous health
                needed<span class="del"> to maintain its standing</span> to 
       &#8593;constantly&#8595;
     forge forward.
                <span class="del">A nation drawing more than half of its 
       &#8593;future&#8595;
     population
            from</span></p>
        <p>The further contention is made, etc.</p>
        <p>I am frequently asked if I am not proud of the great progress made in this movement
            during my lifetime. I am reminded that there has been a general breakdown of secrecy and
            ignorance, not only on the subject of birth control, but relating to the entire field of
            sex education. Birth Control <span class="del">is recognized today as</span> has won legal and medical
            recognition as an important branch of preventive public health procedure.
                <span class="del">Magazines</span></p>
        <p>A new literature has been created. Thousands of pamphlets and books have been written on
            this subject since 1916. This literature has been made available both to the public and
            to the medical profession.</p>
        <p>Magazines 
       &#8593;and publications&#8595;
     outstanding for their conservatism are today
            frankly dealing with the social implications of birth control, <span class="del">although</span> with
            appropriate editorial implications.</p>
        <p>National public polls taken among all classes of population reveal from that 80% desire
            extension of birth control service under medical guidance. The same polls reveal
                <span class="del">that</span> the public mind is no-longer confused, that and understands that
            birth control is <span class="del">
                
        [<em>really exactly the reverence of abortion</em>?]
    
            </span> not abortion.</p>
        <p>Nearly 400 birth control clinics have been established under 
	[<em>page(s) </em>]
	And
            from all their letters and from the personal problems and tragedies, which strangers in
            increasing numbers constantly laid before me, came a clear-cut understanding of the part
            birth control could and must eventually play in any constructive program of
            race-building.</p>
        <p>We went forward therefrom from the beginning with a broad program. We stressed the
            importance of parents refraining entirely from bringing children into the world if they
            themselves suffered from insanity, feeble-mindedness or a venereal disease. We called
            upon parents who, though normal themselves, had already brought mental defectives into
            the world, to avoid the risk of ruining another life, much as they might desire a normal
            child. <span class="del">We pleaded for the right of every woman, rich or poor, sick or well, to
                obtain the necessary kn </span></p>
        <p>We urged the necessity of giving contraceptive information to women suffering from
            tuberculosis, heart or kidney disease, to <span class="del">cut</span>
            
       &#8593;lower&#8595;
     the death rates from these diseases which are seriously complicated by
            pregnancy.</p>
        <p>We pleaded for the right of every woman, rich or poor, sick or well, to obtain the
            necessary <span class="del">information</span> knowledge to space the births of her children;
                
       &#8593;we&#8595;
     pointed <span class="del">to</span>
            
       &#8593;out&#8595;
     the statistical evidence that children born 
       &#8593;one year apart die at
                the rate of 147 per thousand; born two years apart the death rate falls to 96 per
                thousand; while children born<span class="del"> three years apart to 86 per thousand</span>&#8595;
    
            three years apart have the best chance of survival, and give <span class="del">the</span> children
            already born 
       &#8593;in the family&#8595;
     their opportunity for the mother&#8217;s undivided
            attention during the first critical years of life.</p>
        <p>We emphasized the importance of the family income in determining family size, and pointed
            out that a father with an earning capacity to take care of only two children should not
            have ten or twelve to become a burden upon <span class="del">the family and</span> the community. And
            lastly, we made a plea for marriage itself. We urged that young married people be given
            knowledge to enable them to make a fine thing of marriage by having at least a year or
            two for adjustment to each other, physically, 
       &#8593;mentally,&#8595;
     and spiritually,
            before assuming the responsibilities of parenthood.</p>
        <p>The American public listened, and approved. To them it was &#8220;just plain common-sense&#8221;. The
            masses, especially the working people, were with me, etc. etc.</p>
        <p>In India I heard the proverb: &#8220;Knowledge is to know what to do, skill is
                knowing how to do it, virtue is in doing it&#8221;. We have in birth control a new
            instrument for freedom. It makes possible a larger life, the creation of a finer race.
                <span class="del">We have the knowledge and the skill to apply that knowledge</span>. 
       &#8593;We have
                this knowledge. <span class="del">We possess</span> We have developed skill to apply our
                knowledge.&#8595;
     When shall we as a nation <span class="del">pass the virtue of utilizing the
                knowledge we have</span> USE our knowledge and our skill, 
       &#8593;and acquire
                virtue?&#8595;
