            in Reading, PA, as part of the Woman's
                Club half-hour radio program. Sanger's speech was opened with the following
            announcement: Margaret Sanger, who is recognized as the leader of the birth control
            movement both in America and abroad, will speak today on &#8220;The Real Meaning of Birth
            control.&#8221; It is fitting that her address should be part of the regular Woman&#8217;s Club
            program since women are so deeply concerned with the cause she advocates, and as
            individuals and organized groups have given her such effective support. Mrs. Margaret
            Sanger ....</p><hr>
    
    
    
        <p>Birth control means happier, more stable homes. It means better babies and healthier,
            happier mothers. No one can object to these aims, for it is by our common love for
            children and home that we 
       &#8593;women&#8595;
     are all knit together. Birth control means no
            more -- and no less -- than the application of science and reason to the most important
            of all human undertakings -- the 
       &#8593;bearing &amp;&#8595;
     rearing of the next
            generation.</p>
        <p>It seems to me that if people would keep in mind this simple idea, there would not and
            could not be any opposition to birth control. Medical science has taken this matter out
            of the realm of blind chance. We can assist nature, and control births as we control
            other great forces in life. The sum total of all control over the blind forces of nature
            is what we call civilization.</p>
        <p>Birth control means giving mothers a chance to plan their families and space their
            children. It means giving them knowledge with which to make a success of the greatest
            career a woman can have...motherhood.</p>
        <p>Mother love, in the very best sense of the word, is what prompts women 
       &#8593;the world
                over&#8595;
     to plead for birth control information. During the 
       &#8593;20&#8595;
     years of
            my activity in the birth control cause I have received <span class="del">thousands upon thousands
                of</span>
       &#8593;over a million personal&#8595;
     letters from mothers. They ask for
            information for a wide variety of reasons...but the one common reason, that run like a
            golden thread through all the letters, is mother love!</p>
        <p><span class="del">This</span>Here is a letter from a young wife who is looking<span class="del">towards 
	[<em>two words illegible</em>]
	</span>
            
       &#8593;forward to being a mother&#8595;
    : &#8220;I was married when I was
                eighteen,&#8221; She writes. I am not yet twenty and my husband doesn&#8217;t
                feel that we are financially able to care for a child properly yet. I am sure that
                        <span class="del">
	[<em>one word illegible</em>]
	</span>my children 
       &#8593;when
                    I have them&#8595;
     and I will be the better for it, if I can wait until I am
                twenty, at least, before I have a baby. But meantime what shall I do?</p>
        <p>&#8220;I want the truth. I want to find out from someone who knows. I am so
                afraid, I might spoil my chances for motherhood later and I want children. Please
                help 
       &#8593;me&#8595;
    .</p>
        <p><span class="del">Is </span>
       &#8593;Do you think&#8595;
     this young wife entitled to the very best
            information that medical science can give her? I think you will feel with me that she
            is.</p>
        <p>Here is a letter from a child wife who wants to give her 
       &#8593;living&#8595;
     children a
            chance. Mother love impells her to write. As I read her letter 
       &#8593;to you&#8595;
     bear in
            mind that this is an American woman who pleads 
       &#8593;to me&#8595;
     for help, not a mother
            in some far distant land. &#8220;I married at 15,&#8221; she writes, &#8220;and my first baby came before I was 17! Now at 25 I have seven children. We are
                poor and aren&#8217;t able to buy clothes or even food at times. We started farming for
                ourselves last year, and I feel that if I could only keep from having any more
                babies, we could in a few years, give <span class="del">the </span>
       &#8593;these dear&#8595;
     children
                a decent break.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Should this young mother have a chance (to help herself) or should she be left in
            ignorance?</p>
        <p>And one last letter which I am going to read tells a story that is all too typical. &#8220;My husband works on the WPA,&#8221; writes a mother 27 
       &#8593;years old.&#8595;
     &#8220;I have five
                children, the oldest is seven. I would surely be glad if you could help
                me.&#8221;
       &#8593;27 years 20 years more of child bearing&#8595;
    </p>
        <p>
       &#8593;This&#8595;
     family on relief, five children and a mother and father dependent on the
            government for their subsistence. Shall we withold from them knowledge which is needed
            if they are ever to regain a foot hold in life? 
       &#8593;Is it fair? I think you will agree
                with me that it is not.&#8595;
    </p>
        <p>President Roosevelt in one of his recent
            fireside talks said that one-third of the people of America are ill housed, ill clothed and ill nourished. I venture to state
            that <span class="del">one</span>
       &#8593;two&#8595;
     thirds of America&#8217;s mothers are living in fear and
            darkness, that their love for their children born and unborn urges them constantly to
                
       &#8593;worry &amp; to&#8595;
     seek, <span class="del">to learn how to plan their families
                </span>
       &#8593;for knowledge to control the size of the family&#8595;
    .</p>
        <p>Our national Children&#8217;s Bureau has
            studied maternal and infant mortality and has tried to discover how to reduce these
            tragic deaths. It has found out that children should not be born too close together, if
            they are to survive; that mothers should not be too old or too young; that there is a
            direct relation between adequate funds, 
       &#8593;father&#8217;s wages,&#8595;
     economic security,
            and the chances of survival for mothers and infants.</p>
        <p>If we are to take advantage of these findings, that is, if we are to allow mothers to see
                
       &#8593;to it&#8595;
     that their children do not come too close, we must give them
            information as to how to plan their pregnancies.. in other words, we must give them
            birth control information. Birth control for child spacing, birth control when the
            mother is too young, (or too old), birth control when <span class="del">no one </span>
       &#8593;the
                father&#8217;s wages&#8595;
     will not provide proper care 
       &#8593;for the children.&#8595;
     This
            seems to me to admit of no argument 
       &#8593;in a country that calls itself
                    
        [<em>civilized</em>?]
    .&#8595;
    </p>
        <p>I am sure that as I read the letters from mothers, each of you said: &#8220;Why, of course, SHE
            ought to be told what to do.&#8221; Multiply these letters by thousands and millions and you
            will get some picture of the women who should have birth control instruction 
       &#8593;in
                this country of ours.&#8595;
    </p>
        <p>I hasten to add the phrase.. If they want it! Fort this information is not being forced
            upon anyone. It is only for those 
       &#8593;mothers and fathers&#8595;
     who want it and need
            it.</p>
        <p>I am happy to learn that here in Berks County you
            have a wide spread organization for giving birth control instruction to mothers. I am
            told that there are eleven centers in the county, all connected with the central office
            here in Reading. In all these centers doctors are able and willing to give mothers
            advice. Nurses and supplies are furnished by the central office at 408 Franklin Street,
            Reading. Social and Welfare agencies, ministers, and all who are in touch with mothers
            who need this advice are urged to find out about birth control service near their homes
            from the Berks County Office in Reading 
       &#8593;Newer methods, safer, more reliable than
                &#8220;over the counter&#8221; methods are now employed. Your physician can give.&#8595;
    </p>
        <p>This is a fine set up and I am proud to be speaking in a community and a county which has
            so clearly seen the need for this service. I look forward to the time when every county
            in the entire United States will have such service.</p>
        <p>Up to the present time we were working against terrible odds. The so-called Comstock law,
            passed by Congress at the behest of Anthony Comstock more than sixty years ago stood
            inthe way. This law classed the prevention of conception with obscenity, and made it a
            crime to send birth control information or supplied through the mail or by express. It
            also forbid the importation of such material and information. This law was a tragic
            stumbling block. It hindered physicians, it retarded research and scientific study, it
            confused and besmearched and tangled a matter which should rightfully <span class="del">have been
                </span>
       &#8593;be&#8595;
     a part of medical practice.</p>
        <p>Early in my fight to make birth control accessible to all mothers who need it, I saw that
            for real progress this law must be changed. With this in mind, I organized the
                National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control and enlisted
            the aid of individuals and groups. We sought an amendment to the Comstock law, which
            would exempt physicians from its restrictions. Bills were introduced, hearings were
            held, the press gave its support. Organized women&#8217;s clubs were among our staunch
            supporters. Public opinion was aroused and made itself felt. 
       &#8593;Organizations totaling
                over 22 million members endorsed our efforts to get the laws changed.&#8595;
    </p>
        <p>We fought a test case on the importation of birth control materials sent to a physician
            for research purposes. A wise and courageous court decision has brought this legal
            struggle to a victorious close. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals,
            for the second circuit 
       &#8593;on Nov. 30, 1936&#8595;
     handed down a decision which is a
            Bill of Rights for the medical profession in the field of birth control <span class="del">on November
                30th, 1936</span>. This will be hailed as a red letter day when the final history of
            our movement is written. The judges interpreted the Comstock law in the light of modern
            science and modern thought, and said:</p>
        <p>&#8220;We are satisfied that its design was not to prevent the importation, sale
                or carriage by mail of things which might intelligently be employed by conscientious
                and competent physicians for the purpose of saving life or promoting the well being
                of their patients.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Birth control is now legal. The United States government decided not to carry
            the case to the Supreme Court, and thus,
            the decision I have just read in part, becomes, in effect, the law of the land. I urge
            you who are listening to me to read about this case and to get the full meaning of the
            judges decision.</p>
        <p>It opens the way to a new and wider program for birth control. It means that mothers such
            as those who wrote to me pleading for help can 
       &#8593;now&#8595;
     get it as their right and
            their due.</p>
        <p>For birth control is a part of public health work and should be included in public health
            programs. It is a necessary part of all work with mothers and infants and children, and
            all agencies which deal with these problems should and soon will, I prophecy, include it
            as a regular part of their work. 
       &#8593;Two ways you can help send mothers to the center
                for this help, and you can furnish the cost which these poor mothers cannot
                pay.&#8595;
    </p>
        <p>I am happy to be in Pennsylvania where so fine a start has been made, and
            I look to this state, and this county to point the way toward the larger fields into
            which we can now enter.</p>
