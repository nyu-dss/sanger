        <h1>WOMEN OF THE FUTURE</h1>

        <p>We have the wisdom--We have the skill--as demonstrated by man&#8217;s explorations and war
            against microbes and germs where we find all the miracles of the atom and of
            radio-activity.</p>
        <p>In brief, during the last 100 years our wisdom and skill have taken remarkable steps in
            the conquest of the external forces of Nature. Man has tamed and harnessed many natural
            energies and directed them for his own use.</p>
        <p>But before we boast too loudly of these achievements of wisdom, let us evaluate them in
            terms of woman&#8217;s future as the basis of a higher and finer civilization. How can we
            boast of the conquest of the air or the marvels of chemistry when nation after nation
            compels its innocent women and children to protect themselves against these by wearing
            gas masks?</p>
        <p>Why should we take pride in the advance of medical and surgical skill, when its use is to
            be the salvaging of the defectives, the morons and prolonging the lives of the diseased
            millions whose very existence depends upon the continuation of private or public
            charity?</p>
        <p>Consider the vast fortunes--millions--nay billions--of dollars we continue to shovel into
            the bottomless pit of so-called relief--charity. Philanthropy, like the rose by any
            other name, it smells the same.</p>
        <p>This effort to keep alive and increase the population of the diseased, delinquent,
            defective, who in all compassion should never be brought into the world at all, is
            futile extravagance. Its a luxury to salve the conscience of the present generation for
            not using their brains while heaping up mountains of debts for our children&#8217;s children&#8217;s
            children to pay.</p>
        <p>We women of today are too content with our conquests to visualize fully the dangers of
            the future.</p>
        <p>Its one thing to have and another thing to hold what you have. Women&#8217;s freedom is
            endangered. All that she has fought for and gained in Germany has been
            lost and sacrificed to the war mad militarists of that sad country. In
                Japan and Italy it is the same. While women in these
            countries had not made the same strides in the profession and in individual achievement
            as their sisters in Germany, nevertheless what they were aiming for has been stopped and
            they, as a class and sex, have been put back to compete with pack animals in the class
            of servants to man&#8217;s comfort and instruments of his pleasure.</p>
        <p>Its the day of masculine psychology, dedicated to the needs of men.</p>
        <p>Shall women of today be able to hold the freedom they have so far gained? Not unless they
            cease being incubaters for war mad dictators. Not unless they, as a Sex, a Class, a
            United Mass, refuse to waste or allow the misuse of the greatest creative force within
            human nature itself--the creative energy--the force and power of Motherhood. The control
            of the power of woman&#8217;s creative function. Fertility is the main portal to the future.
            Only through the emancipation of her creative energy--Motherhood--can humanity redeem
            itself.</p>
        <p>Civilization is marking time. It is at the cross roads, for in spite of all the
            miraculous achievements of the past century, science, philanthropy, statesmanship, has
            not succeeded in getting humanity out of the man made muddle in which the world finds
            itself today. In fact never has our civilization been nearer to the brink of destruction
            and never in the whole history of this planet has woman&#8217;s place in the creation of the
            structure of the future been so important as it is now today, today! !</p>
        <p>Thanks to the opponents of scientific Birth Control, who keep women and men in ignorance
            of contraception, each day reveals that 50,000 extra babies survive--150,000 are born,
            100,00 die and 50,000 survive each day. These 50,000 who survive contribute to the
            330,000,000 which have been added to the world&#8217;s population of 2,000 millions since
            1920--an increase almost as large in 10 years as the population of
            India.</p>
        <p>The militarists of Germany, Italy and Japan are clamoring for population increase for
            land and land because of population increase our babies are starving but give us more
            babies is the slogan of mad men to which women should turn a deaf ear.</p>
        <p>For let us not forget that in all the successful achievements to conquer the universe
            that man&#8217;s civilization is in bankruptcy. While Successfully spanning the ocean,
            flinging railroads and airlines across continents, circling the globe in the fraction of
            a second with the radio--everything accomplished in the desire to unite peoples and
            nations and to bring them closer together in unity, harmony and understanding, yet
            because of the ceaseless hordes of human beings ever multiplying and increase their
            numbers regardless of quality or place or aim--we find mankind goaded on to a frenzy of
            exploitation and war. A war for land--for markets--for power to destroy, to subjugate
            other nations and races--because of hungry mouths to feed. Millions of women are crushed
            under their burden of poverty and childbearing. They are all too inarticulate to call
            out--too poor to help themselves--too weak to demand their liberties. They look to you
            to help them. Sympathy is not enough--palliative help is not enough--philanthropy is not
            enough. Nothing less can you do than help to set them free--free so that they may help
            themselves and grow in wisdom and enlightenment.</p>
        <p>Instead of a world created and managed by irresponsible hordes in hatred and
            antagonism--let woman hold their present freedom--extend it to all women and guide
            humanity into a future created by all embracing Peace on Earth Good Will to Men through
            the consciousness of Birth Control.</p>
