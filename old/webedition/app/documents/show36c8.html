            The annual report for 1936 also disclosed the plans and
				preparations in progress for an active campaign against syphilis
				and gonorrhea.
            The Bermuda Hotel
					Men&#8217;s Assoc. has asked the Health Dept. to
				provide facilities for the periodic examination of all men and
				women employed in hotels to insure as far as possible, that such
				employees be free from communicable diseases.
            Added to this group should be those who seek work in private
				homes, food shops and laundries. It was requested to see that
				employees have a health card to present to their prospective
				employers to show they are in sound health and free from such
				communicable ailments.
         
         
            <h2>BERMUDA HEALTH REPORT</h2>
            In the enlargement of clinics there will be a department for
				advice in contraception to do its best to lessen the problem of
				too many people untrained for useful work.
            Here again is a forward looking influence and &#8220;While
					the legislature was disinclined to put these diseases upon
					the list of notifiable diseases it is likely to enact
					restraining powers upon those people who habitually spread
					them.&#8221;
            This of course is unfortunate. The only way to stop the spread of
				communicable or transmissible diseases is to treat them as such
				and consider them as small pox, typhoid, measles and other
				diseases should be treated--by isolation and treatment.
            
               Bermuda is an ideal place to live in with no
				&#8220;depressions&#8221; in sight or in the rear--at least in over 300
				years and not since 1860. Before that time they had two (?) but
				the question of taxation is interesting. There is no income
				tax--no inheritance or death tax--no estate or gift or personal
				property tax--no school, no nuisance, no poll or no sales taxes.
				Only a tax for those who own real estate and that amount is at
				the rate of less than $3.00 a thousand. Bermuda is not a
				democracy and that&#8217;s why there is peace and contentment on the
				island.
            Less than 10% of its citizens can vote. Only adult males owning
				60 pound or $300 worth of land have the suffrage. But there is
				one representative in the legislature for every 900 of the
				population. Here you see every child and child of the colored
				population well dressed and clean and tidy. Never have I seen so
				large a group of working colored people so well fed and clothed
				as you see all over Bermuda.
            Here again are no criminal class. No gangs--no underworld--no
				kidnaping--no lynchings. Never in the history of this island has
				there been a lynching. There are no restrictions of race,
				religion or color regarding acquisition of property. But only
				2,000 acres of its 12,500 acres can belong to aliens (including
				Americans). This makes the section of such aliens important.
				They have a policy of selection and investigation and such alien
				must make formal application to the Governor in
				Council--his name is then published in the press and objections
				can be raised and can be heard. The Governor investigates the
				applicants reputation and standing and has power to refuse. This
				power of the Governor&#8217;s has resulted in a homogeneous character
				of alien residents and has prevented that most objectionable of
				all booms--the land boom. Here there is only now beginning the
				social service such as baby clinics but the health Dept. will
				see to it that this sort of palliative interest patterned after
				American ladies use of their leisure time will go hand in hand
				with constructive social work. The Bermudean women themselves
				see thru this and many of them have refused to join the ranks of
				American to organize welfare clinics, baby creches etc. knowing
				that it will encourage the diseased to breed and prolong the
				lives of the types who become dependent and remain depend from
				the cradle to the grave. Not a dependent but a resistant
				population is what is wanted and here it has been and still
				remains in Bermuda.
