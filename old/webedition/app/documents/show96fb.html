       &#8593;Either title may be used&#8595;
     Motherhood Enslaved in Italy or "Mussolini's Insult
			to Womankind"</p>
		<p>The conscription of motherhood appears to be the inevitable next step in the Fascist
			policy of Mussolini. Benito&#8217;s Napoleonic
			complex and <span class="underline">folie de grandeur
			</span> have not as yet reached the point at which he compels by force every Italian
			woman to undergo the ordeal of periodic pregnancy, but he is not lacking sycophants
			ready and willing to give expression to expressed thoughts that lurk uncrystallized
			behind his noble brow. Signor Mario Carli, Time (January 21, 1929) Mario Carli has been making a
			passionate demand for the immediate conscription of Italian motherhood. He is directly
			quoted by Time: &#8220;Every Italian woman must
				give to her country at least one son every two years. A refusal on this point will
				be equivalent to pushing men on the road to polygamy&#8211;-which, however, is contrary to
				Fascist principles. Flight in the face of maternity-&#8211;that divine maternity which
				together with some brief physical suffering, gives the loftiest and deepest joys of
				life (sic!)-&#8211;is as culpable as the desertion of soldiers in the face of the enemy,
				as the attempt of the taxpayer to escape the payment of taxes.....&#8221; Furthermore:
				&#8220;Voluntary barrenness and reducing cures to rid her miserable body of
				superfluous fat are the greatest crimes a woman can commit under the Fascist
				regime.&#8221;</p>
		<p>This tyrannical threat is scracely veiled. It indicates the extent to which the impudent
			dictatorship of Mussolini has gone in Italy. Indifferent or easy-going
			people in this country may retort that this idea is not to be taken seriously. We wish
			that such were the case. But history of the world demonstrates that conscription of
			womanhood has been enforced innumerable times in the past, and that it is not outside
			the bounds of possibility that it can be enforced in the future. Every ambitious
			militarist in the history of the world has called upon women to undertake the rapid
			multiplication of cannon-fodder. History from the forgotten potentates of the East to
				Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte to the rulers who brought
			about the Great War, is crowded with such instances.</p>
		<p>The conscription of motherhood, and the advocacy of &#8220;cradle competition", is a policy
			which every dictator ambitious for his own glory, almost automatically advocated. Thus
			he attempts to assert his own godlike superiority over the rest of humanity. Thus he
			makes of all men soldiers and of all women slaves and breeding-machines. Even if there
			is no immediate danger of Mussolini&#8217;s enforcing the dictum already expressed by his
			editorial sycophant, the very expression of this idea, and the reiterated call for an
			even higher birth-rate in Italy, become of the most sinister significance in European
			politics. Mussolini is demanding of his subjects a greater and greater over-population.
			He is aiming at the production in the Italian peninsula of an expanding and therefore an
			explosive population.</p>
		<p>Increased population-pressure, and eventually over-population, bring with them a lowered
			standard of living, and also a search for new territories, inevitably to be acquired by
			conquest, and therefore by war. Mussolini and his cohorts are therefore progressively
			undermining the instability of Europe and the entire Mediterranean zone.
			The alternatives appear to be: either Birth Control or War. Only a decade has passed
			since the signing of the Armistice and all of us are still paying, in one way or
			another, for the last international debauch of blood.</p>
		<p>Seemingly remote as we may be from the scene of Benito Mussolini&#8217;s strutting theatricals,
			all of us are thus involved in this last insult cast in the face of Occidental
			civilization. While the material prosperity of Italy continues-&#8211;a prosperity dependent
			to no slight extent upon the millions of dollars annualy expended in Italy by American
			travellers and visitors-&#8211;the Fascist regime will continue to take credit for the
			country&#8217;s good fortune.</p>
		<p>The insult to Italian womanhood uttered by Mario Carli is an insult to all womankind.
			American women to whom the ancient glories of Italy have made an esthetic appeal, would
			do well to consider these implications. If they would courageously decide to postpone
			all travel in Italy until that country again demonstrates its right to a place in
			Occidental civilization, an invaluable lesson in discipline and international courtesy
			would not be long in demonstrating its value. Those who respect women will stay out of
			Italy until the last act of her present tragedy has been played.</p>
