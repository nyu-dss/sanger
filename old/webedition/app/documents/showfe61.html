        <h1>National Security and Birth Control</h1>
        <h3>BY MARGARET SANGER</h3>
        <p>Men and women often congratulate me upon having won my long battle
            for birth control. Their attention has been arrested, perhaps, by
            those skilfully composed advertisements for commercial
            contraceptives which are now accepted by great metropolitan dailies
            and highly respectable monthlies. Therefore these good folk
            erroneously assume that all legal obstacles to the dissemination of
            birth-control information have been wiped off our statutes. Time
            after time I am called on to explain, with such patience as I can
            summon to this tiresome task, that this assumption is far from the
            truth. In this enlightened year of the New Deal, 1935, the Penal Code of the United States still classifies the science of contraception
            with filthy French photographs and its advocates and practitioners
            as lewd, lacivious, and obscene criminals, threatening punishment by
            heavy fines and long sentences in federal penitentiaries.</p>
        <p> Permit me to summarize the actual status of our present federal laws
            involving the delicate question of contraception.</p>
        <p> Section 211 of the United States Penal Code prohibits the sending or
            receiving by and from the United States mails information and
            supplies pertaining to the prevention of conception. <span class="italics">There are no exemptions.</span>
        </p>
        <p> Section 245 of this same code prohibits the sending or receiving by
            an express company or common carrier of information or supplies
            relating to the prevention of conception. <span class="italics">There are no exemptions.</span>
        </p>
        <p> Sections 311 and 312 pertain to the Territories and Districts under
            federal control and are even more rigid in their prohibitions,
            declaring that even the <span class="italics">possession</span> of
            any article intended for the prevention of conception constitutes a
            crime. <span class="italics">No exemptions!</span></p>
        <p> Convictions under these statutes are punishable by the imposition of
            fines ranging from $2,000 to $5,000 or imprisonment for five years
            or both.</p>
        <p> Twenty-one years ago, when I began to challenge the ethical validity
            of these laws, the tragic effects of passive and unthinking
            submission to them were obvious to anyone with eyes to observe. This
            national tragedy was reflected in a high infant-mortality rate, the
            evils of child labor, and the prevalence of that most desperate
            remedy, abortion. Scientific research in the technique of
            contraception was nonexistent. Hospitals, clinics, medical
            societies, and schools could not jeopardize their very existence by
            any overt defiance of the laws of the land, even if they recognized
            the importance of the problem. The same restrictive and blighting
            effect exists to-day. Not only are these federal statutes in
            conflict with state laws, but they are endlessly confusing to
            scientists and physicians legitimately concerned in genetic research
            and racial health. In those states which permit, even with certain
            restrictions, the dissemination of contraceptive advice, physicians
            are compelled to bootleg the interstate transportation of supplies
            and reports, since the United States mails and even the common
            carriers must not be sullied by such information! While certain
            courageous physicians may indeed ignore the existence of these
            statutes in their private practice, the policies of hospitals,
            clinics and medical schools cannot admit transactions specifically
            condemned as against the statutes of the Penal Code.</p>
        <p> Our first task was to tear aside the heavy veils of silence which
            shrouded the whole subject; next, to inaugurate the interminable
            task of enlightening public opinion, a job which brought with it
            ridicule and stinging denunciation, not to mention police raids,
            indictments, and jails. However, we succeeded finally in opening
            clinics and in keeping them open--after long legal battles and with
            definite and narrow restrictions. We have won the adherence of
            enlightened public opinion. But still those sections of the Penal
            Code have remained unchanged, unamended, still a menace to social
            and economic security.</p>
        
            <h2>II.</h2>
            <p>With the revolution in public opinion concerning the ethical
                validity of birth control, with indeed the advent of a more
                liberal and less puritanical era, we have witnessed the rise to
                power of a class which can be compared only to the late
                unlamented bootlegger. Fully conscious of the legal restrictions
                concerning the prevention of conception, the larger and more
                reputable wholesale druggists, financially well able to
                establish research projects to investigate the chemistry of
                contraception, remain nevertheless reluctant to enter a field
                which might involve them in legal difficulties. But others are
                less scrupulous, greedier for immediate profits. The charlatan,
                the little fellow, fully cognizant of the desperation of
                thousands upon thousands of mothers (discovered sometimes by
                house-to-house canvassing), began to put on the market
                more-or-less-thinly disguised contraceptives. These products are
                not described as contraceptives but, ambiguously, as aids to
                feminine hygiene and so forth. No overt promises are made, no
                guarantees given. Clever copywriters in advertising agencies
                solve this delicate problem by suggestive ambiguity. The
                rewards, apparently, have been enormous. Today the
                advertisements of such dubious products appear in respectable
                dailies and monthlies which even fifteen years ago jeered at me
                for the indecency of mentioning birth control and for daring to
                challenge the federal government to send me to its
                penitentiary.</p>
            <p> Careful laboratory tests have been made of a large number of
                these so-called commercial contraceptives, with this synthetic
                names. In chemical analyses of the spermicidal power of some
                thirty-two of these products now actually on the market, no
                fewer than forty-five per cent failed to kill the sperm in one
                or more of three tests. At least twenty-five per cent showed
                serious defects in mechanical functioning, such as power of
                dissolving, volume and stability of foam, and so on. Yet these
                products are elaborately displayed in drugstore windows, their
                function suggested with all the skill and persuasion of the
                advertising art, and never--to evade conflict with the federal
                statutes--are they actually described as contraceptives.
                Retailed at cruelly exorbitant prices, they exploit the
                desperation, the ignorance, the hopes, and the credulity of
                millions of American women, whose hygienic and sexual education
                is specifically forbidden by federal statute.</p>
            <p> The commercial success of such products is but one more
                demonstration of the existence of the universal demand for
                contraceptive knowledge, of that submerged class of underfed and
                overbred motherhood, praying silently or crying aloud in anguish
                for deliverance from the incessant toil of childbearing, as
                expressed by thousands of letters still pouring in, pleading for
                knowledge. The emergence of the &#8220;safe-period&#8221; theory sponsored
                by Catholic writers and doctors--a dubious compromise, with no
                guarantee of certainty or reliability--is indicative that even
                the archenemy of birth control, the Roman Catholic
                    Church, must find some answer to the increasing
                demands of its women. But, like the commercial contraceptives,
                the rhythmic theory of &#8220;lawful&#8221; and
                    &#8220;natural&#8221; birth control can give no
                assurance of certainty, tested reliability, nor of universal
                efficacy.</p>
            <p> Such manifestations demonstrate that indiscriminate
                dissemination of birth control &#8220;knowledge&#8221;
                is fraught with danger. On the basis of study of fertility and
                contraception among 4,945 married women,* a distinguished Johns Hopkins scientist
                reaches the conclusion that hundreds and hundreds of women who
                do not practice contraception are pleading for information so
                that they may.</p>
            <p>
                The logic of our results would seem to point
                    clearly and unequivocally to the probability that prompt
                    removal of all legal restriction to the free dissemination
                    of contraceptive information, and barriers to the
                    unrestricted distribution of contraceptive devices, would
                    tend to have the effect of bringing the differential
                    fertility of social classes more nearly into balance again.
                    . . . It seems clear that if the restrictions . . . were
                    removed, it might somewhat lighten the burden of poverty
                    with which our children and grandchildren bid fair to be
                    faced. *Raymond Pearl: A Study of Family Limitation. &#8220;Milbank Memorial
                Fund Quarterly,&#8221; July 1934. </p>
        
        
            <h2>III.</h2>
            <p> That the birth rate is highest and the family largest in what we
                term the lowest social class in this country--the unemployed and
                those already supported by relief agencies--is a fact
                universally recognized. This differential birth rate has not
                only persisted, but has been emphasized by the depression. On
                the basis of a recent survey, Messrs. Edgar Sydenstricker and G.
                St.J. Perrott point out that</p>
            <p>
                low social status, unemployment and low income
                    in 1932 went hand in hand with a high illness rate and
                        <span class="">increased malnutrition among children.</span> It
                    was in these same groups of families that a high birth rate
                    prevailed. Whatever the broad implications of the findings
                    may be, it is evident that a high birth rate during the
                    depression prevailed in families which could least afford,
                    from any point of view, to assume this added
                    responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>This, despite the added fact that today thousands of potential
                mothers, rather than bring children into a hostile world, are
                willing to run the risk of the most dangerous remedy of
                all--abortion. A conservative investigator, Fred J. Taussig,
                M.D., estimates that approximately 800,000 abortions are
                performed every year in the United States.</p>
            <p>
                With a mortality rate of 2.1 per cent for these
                    800,000 abortions, the number of annual deaths from abortion
                    is about 17,000.
            </p>
            <p> Furthermore, the same authority assures us that there can be no
                question of the existence of an abortion
                    &#8220;racket&#8221; by which the professional
                abortionist has to pay for protection. City officials and the
                criminal classes, he thinks, divide this graft.</p>
            <p> The profiteer, the bootlegger, and the abortionist are reaping
                their ill-gotten gains undisturbed by the existing statutes. If,
                as Dr. Pearl suggests, all restrictions for the free
                dissemination of birth-control information should be removed, we
                must exercise foresight in assuring that contraception and its
                technique should be placed in competent hands. Upon the basis of
                the results obtained in our research clinics, now conducted
                without violation of New York State
                laws, we are certain that this technical aspect of contraception
                is first and foremost a medical problem which requires expert
                diagnosis for individual solution. It is upon this basis that
                the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
                    Control is urging the passage by Congress of two bills
                amending the federal statutes summarized earlier. These bills
                (S600 and HR2000), already introduced would dissociate the idea
                of contraception from that of obscenity and would sanction the
                use of the United States
                    mails by physicians giving contraceptive information;
                likewise the sale of contraceptives by druggists filling the
                prescriptions of such duly licensed physicians. It would apply
                also to medical colleges, hospitals, and clinics licensed in any
                state or territory or the District of Columbia, with the exception of a state
                in which such use is specifically prohibited by law.</p>
            <p> National planning for economic and social security can, in the
                long run, produce no real benefits unless such plans be based
                upon the cornerstone of family security through family planning.
                As long as the procreative instinct is allowed to run reckless
                riot through our social structure, there can be no real family
                security. As long as the New Deal and our paternalistic
                Administration refuse to recognize this truism, grandiose
                schemes for security may eventually turn into subsidies for the
                perpetuation of the irresponsible classes of society. Social
                workers and palliative specialists who have become accustomed to
                the administration of charities and whose personal prestige is
                rooted in their careers as directors of the destinies of the
                hopelessly indigent unconsciously resent any program that
                threatens the existence of that class. Most of them prefer their
                own rose-water deodorants to any fundamental policy which would
                automatically revolutionize conditions of the underprivileged
                and help them to help themselves.</p>
            <p> If children are to be brought into the world by chance--inert,
                undernourished, victims of hereditary diseases-- to be brought
                into a world to live their lives as dependent and indigents; if,
                in short, this differential birth rate is to be still further
                widened between classes, the doom of this nation is already
                written. If our New Dealers turn a deaf ear to the cries of the
                Forgotten Woman, they are attempting to solve the problem of
                economic security without due consideration for the basic human
                factors involved in that problem, which must be recognized. </p>
