        <p>A few years ago the people of the world, for the first time in the history of man, were
                <span class="underline">confident</span> that 
       &#8593;at last&#8595;
     an enduring peace
            could be achieved. But today the world is swept by the most brutal war that man has
                <span class="underline">ever</span> known. Even during those years when nations were
            planning for peace, there were forces 
       &#8593;already&#8595;
     at work that made this
                
       &#8593;Second World&#8595;
     war inevitable.</p>
        <p>This war is really, but one phase of a struggle which has been in progress throughout
                <span class="del">all of</span>
            
       &#8593;the&#8595;
     history 
       &#8593;of mankind&#8595;
    . Actually those same forces of <span class="underline">destruction</span> which are now sweeping Europe
            like a fire
       &#8593;,&#8595;
    
            <span class="underline">yearly</span> take the lives of millions throughout the world--of
            thousands even in our 
       &#8593;own&#8595;
    
            <span class="underline">country</span>. 
       &#8593;For&#8595;
     As long as people are born into
            the world by <span class="underline">chance</span> rather than by the intelligent choice
            of parents, they will die by the thousands, some even before they have begun to live
                
       &#8593;at all&#8595;
    , others before they have lived out <span class="del">a normal life</span>
            
       &#8593;their First 5 years&#8595;
    .</p>
        <p>We are horrified because in the present world war so much suffering has fallen on
            innocent women and children. In the desperate struggle for survival which continues even
            in years of peace, it is the <span class="underline">children</span>, and the <span class="underline">women</span> who bear <span class="del">them</span>
            
       &#8593;the children&#8595;
    , that suffer the heaviest toll.</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Fourteen thousand mothers lost in childbirth!</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Seventy-five thousand babies born dead!</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Seventy thousand babies lost in the first month of life!</p>
        <p class="blockquote"><span class="underline">These</span> are the casualties in our <span class="underline">own</span> country during <span class="underline">one year of
                peace</span>. Or <span class="underline">is</span> this peace? The war in Europe has
                <span class="underline">not</span> killed more innocents than these. <span class="underline">But these are only the dead.</span> What of those who survive?
                
       &#8593;What of the living?&#8595;
     Let us consider <span class="del">the</span>
            
       &#8593;our own American&#8595;
     children.</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Six million are improperly nourished.</p>
        <p class="blockquote">A million have weak or damaged hearts</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Three millions have impaired hearing</p>
        <p class="blockquote">A million have defective speech</p>
        <p class="blockquote">850,000 definitely 
       &#8593;are&#8595;
     feeble-minded</p>
        <p class="blockquote">300,000, crippled</p>
        <p class="blockquote">400,000, Tubercular</p>
        <p class="blockquote">50,000, partially blind</p>
        <p>And the cause of this?</p>
        <p>Mothers dying needlessly, in giving birth to children who might better not have been
            born; <span class="del">fighters</span>
            
       &#8593;men&#8595;
     fighting a hopeless fight to provide for their families the necessities
            of decent living; young men and young women forced by need or neglect into lawlessness,
            nations vying with one another for land with which to support their surplus
            population--these all spring from the same cause, the heedless, unplanned <span class="underline">reproduction</span> of 
       &#8593;the&#8595;
     human <span class="del">beings</span>
            
       &#8593;race&#8595;
    .</p>
        <p>But <span class="underline">these</span> are the conditions of the jungle. We take it for
            granted that in the jungle thousands will die by violent death or by starvation for
            every <span class="underline">one</span> that survives. But among human being
       &#8593;s&#8595;
    
            this is the very abdication of reason.</p>
        <p>It is said that the ability to <span class="underline">laugh</span> distinguishes
                <span class="del">men</span>
            
       &#8593;man&#8595;
     from the lower animals. Another characteristics of man alone is the
            ability to <span class="underline">plan</span> the birth of his young. This is the
            foundation upon which he can build a way of life which offers to every individual the
            full promise of his in-born potentialities. Planned parenthood, Children born <span class="underline">because</span> they are wanted, because their parents can provide
            for them the environment of a wholesome life; the family-basic unit of any civilized
            society--strong in its loyalties, cheerful in its outlook, self-sustaining and
            self-respecting.</p>
        <p>Science has given us the means of planned parenthood. Contraception, or the evidence of
            unintended conception, is possible to every couple. The methods are simple,
            reliable--made so by years of patient research. This knowledge is, or should be, a part
            of the working equipment of every practising physician.</p>
        <p>Why, then, are children still born unwanted, to live in neglect, and to become charges of
            society?</p>
        <p>It is not because of the indifference of women. This is certain. It is not because of the
            callousness of men. Men as well as women benefit by planned parenthood, and they too are
            seeking the means to achieve it.</p>
        <p>It is not because of the inability or the unwillingness of doctors to advise their
            patients. A few valiant leaders of the medical profession have fought <span class="underline">for years</span> to make planned parenthood a reality.</p>
        <p>Planned parenthood is <span class="underline">not now</span> a reality <span class="underline">because</span> of the shame with which so-called reformers of an
            older generation invested any matter related to the love of men and women,
                
       &#8593;idea&#8595;
    
            <span class="del">and because one religious body has tried to impose upon <span class="underline">all</span> the people its won conception of the proper marriage
                relationship</span>. <span class="del">These two</span>
            
       &#8593;This&#8595;
     attitude, by tactics unworthy of a democracy, <span class="del">were</span>
            
       &#8593;was&#8595;
     written into laws which restricted the information which the medical
            profession could give to a patient, even though life itself were at stake. A more
            enlightened age has restored to the medical profession its <span class="underline">inalienable</span> right to use the full resources of science for the health and
            welfare of patients. Massachusetts, however, remains as a dark area.</p>
        <p>Massachusetts well may be proud of its record of caring for its mothers and children, of
            the schools it has built, of its health services and of its care of the old and the
            dependent. But of what avail are these in meeting the greatest need of any family if the
            law in Massachusetts <span class="underline">so curbs</span> the rights of the medical
                profession
       &#8593;,&#8595;
     that a <span class="underline">doctor cannot tell</span> a
            patient how she can <span class="del">avoid a pregnancy?</span>
            <span class="del">[illegible]</span>
            
       &#8593;plan a family.&#8595;
    </p>
        <p>In five years, from 1934 to 1938, in this rich state, 6,702 infants under one year of age
                <span class="underline">died</span> in six of its largest cities, 14,207 died
            throughout the state. There were 9,092 still births. One thousand, five hundred and
            twenty-nine mothers died in child birth. Most of these were needless deaths. The waste
            and the human suffering they caused could so easily have been avoided. There was the
            knowledge and there was the eagerness to learn. But <span class="underline">ignorance</span>, with a brutality as great as war&#8217;s, brought death at the point of
            life&#8217;s beginning, or its highest achievement.</p>
        <p>What does the law in Massachusetts say? It says that <span class="underline">anyone</span>
            giving information regarding <span class="underline">any means</span> whatever of
                <span class="del">preventing pregnancy</span>
            
       &#8593;contraception&#8595;
     is guilty of a crime
       &#8593;,&#8595;
     and shall be punished by
            imprisonment in a state prison or be fined. In 1938, the highest court of this state
            held that the law is &#8220;sweeping, <span class="underline">absolute</span>,
                and devoid of <span class="underline">ambiguity</span>&#8221; and &#8220;contains no <span class="underline">exceptions</span>&#8221;.!!</p>
        <p>Well, this law is not going to stay on the statute books. It is in conflict with the
            rights of the medical profession, and with the interests of the people. It runs counter
            to the basic liberties guaranteed to us in the bill of rights. It has no place among the
            laws of any democracy.</p>
        <p>Throughout the nations the great movement for planned parenthood is gaining momentum.
            Leaders in every walk of life are represented in the national sponsoring committee. In
            two states information about child spacing is regularly given through the public health
            services. Local public health units in hundreds of communities in other states are doing
            the same. Educators, scientists, clergymen, see planned parenthood as a way to
            strengthen our human resources in a time of great national need. Most important of all,
            in the heart of every woman, is the conviction that women should have the right to
            decide when they shall bring children into the world.</p>
        <p>Only in Massachusetts and her sister-state Connecticut does the law stand
            as an obstacle to this movement. Only here has ignorance gained a victory over science,
            shame over the dignity of human life. This is <span class="underline">not of the choosing
            </span>of the people of this state today.</p>
        <p>The people of Massachusetts want this law changed. In a recent poll by an impartial
            agency, 82 per cent of the people of this state <span class="underline">declared</span>
            that they would vote for legislation which would free doctors to prescribe
                contraception
       &#8593;,&#8595;
    
            <span class="">for their patients</span>. The medical profession itself is taking leadership in a
            campaign at <span class="del">thi</span> this time to see that the wishes of the people, thus
            expressed, result in a change in this outmoded law.</p>
        <p>You will want to help in this campaign, and in saying that I know that I am speaking to
            the great majority of those who are listening.</p>
        <p>All that you need do is to register your will. Write to the  Massachusetts Mother&#8217;s
                Health Council, 143 Newbury Street, Boston, or
            in care of this station, and say that you want to sign the petition to the legislature
            for restoration of medical rights in Massachusetts. You will be sent a blank. Your
            signature on that blank will be a blow to the bigotry and ignorance which now keeps
            motherhood in bondage in Massachusetts.</p>
