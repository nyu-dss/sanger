<h1>From Woman's Standpoint</h1>
<h3 class="italics">By Margaret Sanger</h3>
<p>From the woman's standpoint, the steel strike, like all
strikes, is a struggle within a struggle.  When the men quit work
to force higher wages, shorter hours, and better working
conditions, the women must go through that battle with them.  But
they go through it in loyalty to their husbands rather than in
any well-founded hope of materially bettering their own
situations.  Whether the men win or lose the contest with the
employers, woman's battle to obtain necessities and comforts for
her children and herself must go on unceasingly.</p>
<p>It will always be so while she brings unlimited families
into the world.</p>
<p>Labor's deepest problem today is not the result, primarily,
of lack of organization nor of exploitation.  It is true that
labor must organize more closely; it is true that it suffers from
exploitation; it is true that the modern industrial system is
breaking labor upon a merciless wheel.  But it is also true that
the unwanted battalions of babies, springing from the wombs of
workers' wives, make all these hard conditions possible.  Without
these children, who constitute the burdens and the real danger of
the workers, the workers would be a compact body, they could not
be exploited, and the task of producing the world's necessities
and comforts would not--could not--be the cruel ordeal that it is
today.</p>
<p>Had the workers applied the principle of limitation,
exemplified in their labor organizations, to their families, they
would have long ago solved labor's problems and solved them in a
way that would have made the earth a much happier place in which
to live.  Labor has won all that it has attained through the
principle of limitation; but because it has gone on bringing huge
families into existence, it has produced its own competitors, its
own strike-breakers, its own chains.  While it continues to
produce these, it will not be able to cope with organized
capital--it will not be able to bring about any great permanent
betterment of its situation.</p>
<p>So far as the woman is concerned, if another baby arrives
every year or two, strike victories mean very little advantage to
her or her children.  Rising prices quickly eat up the increase
of wages won by the husband, or if he has a small margin left, he
spends it outside the home for his own pleasure or comfort.  This
is inevitable under the present conditions.  </p>
<p>Tired out by the monotonous strain of labor, a human being
wants some place in which to relax and rest.  Home, to the
breadwinner, is not such a place.  There are too many children
there--he can have neither quiet nor the society of his wife. 
He, himself, can escape--and he does.  A strike victory means a
little something to him--particularly if he has won shorter
hours.  Then he can have time to think--and, thinking, will
ultimately solve his problem.  </p>
<p>But the woman cannot escape.  There are no shorter hours for
her.  She is on guard, under unceasing strain, twenty-four hours
in the day.  Each additional baby intensifies that strain. 
Whether the husband has bettered his individual lot or not, there
is never enough margin for the mother of a large brood to make
ends meet.  She has still to keep the best food for the
wage-earner, in order that he may continue to earn.  She still
has to save the next-best food for the children.  To clothe the
children, she must still go without decent clothing for herself.</p>
<p>She has no time to think--she has no time to grapple with
her own larger problems.  And as long as she continues to bring
forth a child every year or so, neither she nor her husband will
solve their problems.</p>
<p>Let it be repeated--labor has been and still is
short-sighted.  Had it, when it began a generation ago to strive
toward abolishing wage slavery, taken precautions against a
future crop of wage slaves, its problem would now have been
solved and its victory secure.  Had labor made Birth Control a
conscious part of its propaganda, had it limited its births as it
has striven to limit the numbers in its organizations, there
would be no strike-breakers, no idle men, no women or children at
killing toil, and the workman's home would be a home indeed.  And
labor will go on pretty much in its present way until it learns
this lesson.</p>
