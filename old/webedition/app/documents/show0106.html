        <h1>Birth Control: Margaret Sanger's Reply to Theodore
                Roosevelt</h1>
        <p>Editor, The Metropolitan
                Magazine.</p>
        <p> Dear Sir:</p>
        <p>The trouble with nearly all writers who oppose birth control is that they consider only
            proximate instead of ultimate effects. They want large numbers of high quality citizens.
            Therefore, they contend, let the existing high quality citizens have more children. They
            assume that families now living in comfortable circumstances will be able to maintain
            their standards, no matter how many additional children are born. In other words, they
            expect quality to take care of itself.</p>
        <p>We advocates of birth control know that one cannot make quality by insisting on quantity.
            One cannot make <span class="italics">better</span> people simply by having <span class="italics"> more</span> people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roosevelt says that in order to make a man into a better citizen, we must first have
            the man. The right environment in which to receive and develop the man is of greater
            importance. Society, as at present constituted, does not provide the means of rearing
            unrestricted hordes of human beings into intelligent citizenship. Therefore, birth
            control has become necessary as a check upon the blind working of ignorance and
            poverty.</p>
        <p>When considering the problems of the class known as the "submerged tenth," even the most
            conservative are willing to admit its need of birth control. But it is an error to
            suppose that the proportion of families sunk in destitution constitutes only one-tenth
            of the population. Figures are available to prove that it is closer to three-tenths, or
            well over one-quarter. The census of 1910 shows that 10.7 per cent of married women in
            the  United States went to work outside their homes to help keep their
            families together. There, without looking further, is a submerged tenth among women
            alone. There is little doubt that the proportion of wage-earning mothers has greatly
            increased since 1910, and it is equally beyond question that an enormous number of
            poverty-stricken women are prevented by their excessive family burdens from seeking to
            earn money outside the home.</p>
        <p>They who ban the open and legal dissemination of birth control practically say-- Let the
            slums spawn if they must; the prime aim is to goad the upper classes into greater
            fertility. Both effects are deplorable. There is no greater national waste than the
            spawning of the slums, with its resultant high maternal and infant mortality rates,
            child labor and prostitution. As for increasing the fertility of the upper classes, it
            is certain that the majority of such parents even now have as many children as any
            rational eugenist could ask them to do were he in possession of all the facts of each
            case--health, income, educational needs and provision for the future, etc. Admitting
            that they give birth to fewer children, the fact is that they bring to maturity almost
            as many, relatively, as the poor succeed in doing. The following figures prepared by the
            French authority, Dr. J. Bertillon,
            demonstrate this point.</p>
        <p>For the whole of France, 86.6 per cent of the children of rich parents
            reach twenty years of age, and only 48.6 per cent of the children of poor parents. The
            figures for  Paris give a fertility rate of about
            100 births per 1,000 poor mothers, and of about 50 per 1,000 rich mothers. Combining
            these with the former figures, it appears that for each 1,000 rich mothers there would
            be 43.3 children surviving to twenty years annually, and for each 1,000 poor mothers
            only 48.6 children. In France, as elsewhere, the poor mother is handicapped in rearing
            her surviving offspring. This results in a percentage of unfitness, and the contribution
            of the high birth-rate classes to the adult effective population is, consequently, no
            higher proportionately than that of the low birth-rate classes.</p>
        <p>The world over, the intelligent parents of three children or less have been, and are, the
            upholders of national standards. This is particularly true of America.</p>
        <p>By regarding the bringing of a child into the world as a great social responsibility, the
            modern American woman shows a fine sense of morality. Since the State does not compel
            marriage, but leaves it to individual choice, she does not see why motherhood, which is
            a much more serious problem, should be enforced.</p>
        <p>The American woman of today is physically and nervously unable to compete with her
            grandmother in the matter of bearing unlimited offspring. In Colonial times, the
            environment was favorable, and women specialized on reproduction with eminent success.
            The prospective mothers of this generation are compelled to divide their creative
            energies between child-bearing and social and economic complexities. It has been
            estimated that last year seven and a half million women were engaged in industry in the
            United States, the majority of them in nerve-racking trades. Ten hours a day at a sewing
            machine or a telephone switchboard are not conducive to either physical or mental
            receptiveness to maternity.</p>
        <p>It is a very common Fallacy that the decadence of Greece and
                Rome was due to the artificial limitation of offspring. It is
            surprising to find a historian like Mr. Roosevelt repeating the error. During the
            periods he refers to, birth control was, indeed, practiced, and as a result some of the
            greatest poets, thinkers and geniuses, generally, of that, or any other age, were
            developed. Birth Control was one of the few serious moral forces at work tending to
            preserve the integrity of the State. But, in Rome, at all events, it was not quite
            effective enough to combat the soft luxury and vice which had come as an aftermath of an
            orgy of conquest. </p>
        <p>The falling birth rate of college graduates, as demonstrated by the statistics gathered
            in Harvard and Yale
            by John C. Phillips, should not be considered
            alarming. The best thing that the modern American college does for young men or women is
            to make of them highly sensitized individuals, keenly aware of their responsibility to
            society. They quickly perceive that they have other duties toward the State than
            procreation of the kind blindly practiced by the immigrant from Europe.
            They cannot be deluded into thinking quantity superior to quality. But they can be
            trusted not to suffer extinction. The operation of natural law will prevent the ratio of
            reproduction from remorselessly falling to zero. In this, as in all other population
            phenomena, a new level of fertility is being sought--that is all.</p>
        <p>In many other isolated groups, the same process can be observed today. The editor of
                The Journal of Heredity has found that out of 1,512
            families of Methodist ministers in America, the average number of children is now only
            3.12. The birth rate in the English Society of Friends has fallen from 20 per
            1,000 in 1876 to less than 8 per 1,000 in 1915. Or, to take an illustration from an
            entire racial group, statistics show that the size of Jewish families in Europe has been
            rapidly decreasing since 1876. They contain now only two to four children, with a
            growing tendency to restrict the number to two, while only twenty years ago they had
            four to six. </p>
        <p>But it is well to emphasize that we advocates of birth control are not so much disturbed
            by the stationary birth rate of the thinking classes, as by the reckless propagation of
            the ignorant. We consider that the falling birth rate is a world-wide movement of
            civilization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roosevelt quotes approvingly the statement of a French newspaper that the present war
            was really due to the increasing birth rate of Germany and the falling
            birth rate of France. Had Germany to face 60,000,000 Frenchmen, instead of 39,000,000,
            this authority holds, the war would not have taken place. In my opinion, two
            over-populated nations would have fought even more readily and long before. The war was
            due to the over-populated nations would have fought even more readily and long before.
            The war was due to the over-population of Germany and Russia, not to
            France's stationary population. But once put to the ordeal, the French soldiers, sturdy
            and highly individualistic because they came from small families, proved at the Battle
            of the Marne and  Verdun the efficacy of birth
            control, by defeating an enemy mechanically much more formidable than themselves.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the same Germany who had failed against France easily routed the
            hordes of Russian soldiers, who owed their numbers to an unlimited system of reckless
            propagation. Germany's birth rate is falling. In 1860 it was 37.9 per thousand
            inhabitants and in 1912 only 29.1. It is common knowledge that the economists of Europe
            do not hope for universal peace until the birth rate of Russia also begins to
            decline.</p>
        <p>The intelligent class, with its acceptance of birth control holds the same position in
            American society that France does among the nations of the world.</p>
        <p>It is an error to suppose that woman avoids motherhood because she is afraid to die.
            Rather does she fear to live. She fears a life of poverty and drudgery, weighed down by
            the horror of unwanted pregnancy and tortured by the inability to rear decently the
            children she has already brought into the world.</p>
        <p>Respectfully Yours,</p>
