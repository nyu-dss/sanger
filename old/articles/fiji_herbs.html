<h1>"Fiji Herbs from a Bird Man &ndash; Sanger's Continuing Quest for New Birth Control"</h1>

<p>A world-renowned imitator of bird songs who could extinguish a flame with his
high-pitched warble obtains a plant substance in Fiji that is carefully
controlled by tribal chiefs because it purportedly prevents conception when
brewed and regularly consumed by women. The bird imitator smuggles samples of
the herb out of Fiji in hopes of providing birth control leader Margaret Sanger
with the perfect contraceptive – easy to take, effective and even the
slightest bit tasty.</p>
<p>A bad Hollywood movie pitch? A new novel by T. Coraghessan Boyle? No, you
guessed it: another episode in Margaret Sanger's real life quest for safe,
effective, doctor-less birth control.</p>
<p>Sanger's Clinical Research Bureau in New York regularly assessed the
plausibility of the countless claims of contraceptive breakthrough reported by
everyone from livestock farmers to third-world traveling raconteurs. Mostly
Sanger and her staff had to deal with business opportunists who formulated
natural (and not so natural) concoctions that promised to immobilize sperm,
produce a state of reversible sterilization, or induce miscarriage; they tested
the most promising of these substances or sent them on to independent labs or
interested drug companies. Sanger's close associate in the birth control
movement, the physician and philanthropist Clarence Gamble, used his deep
pockets and international contacts to obtain and examine a number of plant-based
contraceptives – mostly folklore remedies ignored by medical science. By the
1930s, few new ideas for contraceptives, no matter how ludicrous, failed to pass
by either Sanger or Gamble, who both held out hope for a stunning new discovery.</p>
<p>In 1939, though preoccupied with the merger of the two remaining birth
control organizations into the Birth Control Federation of America, Sanger
continued to pursue the most promising new contraceptive formula, an inexpensive
spermicidal foam powder, which had been circulating among clinics since 1935.
The jury was still out as to its effectiveness and long-term safety. She also
continued to follow studies of spermatoxins or sperm immunization brought about
by injecting human or animal sperm into the female to produce antibodies lethal
to sperm, research that peaked in the mid-1930s. Russian investigators and a
Denver doctor had produced startling results with small test groups using
spermatoxins, though their findings were never duplicated by experienced
researchers.</p>
<p>Always open to hearing about potential new methods, Sanger politely listened
to the colorful stories of 70-year-old naturalist Charles Kellogg, who met
Sanger while visiting Tucson in early 1939. Kellogg had heard about a birth
control remedy indigenous to Fiji that explained the low birth rates of the
native peoples there. In a short time he would return to Fiji , where he had
been studying the fire-walkers of M'Benga Island. He promised to report to
Sanger when he got back to his California home in the summer. (Kellogg to MS,
June 21, 1939 [<em>MSM</em> S16:924]; Kellogg, <em>Charles Kellogg, The Nature
Singer, His Book </em>[Morgan Hill, CA, 1929], 141.)</p>
<p>Kellogg, familiar to many as the "California Nature Singer" from his days
as a headline attraction on Broadway and on the vaudeville circuit, claimed he
was born with a syrinx (the vocal organ of birds) in addition to a normal human
larynx. A throat specialist in London verified that the half-rings in Kellogg's
throat mimicked and were greater in number than those in the most well endowed
songbird. This enabled Kellogg not only to reproduce any bird's song, but to
extinguish a gas flame with a high-pitched, shrill note, the climax of his stage
performance and a feat demonstrated before scientists at the University of
California, Berkeley in 1926 during a live radio broadcast. This event prompted
the <em>Los Angeles Times </em>to quip that Kellogg should be employed by the city
to "sing its conflagrations to sleep." Kellogg was also known for his
friendship with the naturalists John Muir and John Burroughs, and for his "travel
log," a twenty-two foot hollowed-out section of redwood affixed atop a truck
bed that Kellogg drove across the U.S. to publicize the devastation of the
redwood forests. (<em>Los Angeles Times</em>, Sept. 14, 1926; <em>New York Times</em>,
Sept. 5, 1949; Kellogg, <em>The Nature Singer</em>, 14, 132, 232)</p>
<p>Upon his return from the South Seas, where he nearly lost his life (he doesn't
say how), Kellogg described to Sanger how he had won over the confidence of
several Fijians, including a young medical student who served as Kellogg's
guide and translator. It was through this medical student's mother, the widow
of a chief, that Kellogg acquired a sample of the Fiji contraceptive herb as
well as directions on how to use it. "As you know," he wrote Sanger, "this
knowledge is so secretly guarded I am fortunate in having been given the full
instructions and the herbs used. I feel I have something valuable ...." He
later reiterated to Sanger that no scientist anywhere knew anything of these
herbs, "It is a secret known only to the chiefs and has been carefully and
strictly preserved by them." (Kellogg to MS, June 21, 1939 and Feb. 21, 1940 [<em>MSM</em>
S16:924;C7:53].)</p>
<p>Sanger was evidently won over by Kellogg's story-telling ability. She told
Gamble some months later that Kellogg "makes great mystery out of the natives
using a contraceptive herb, and it seems to be mixed up with folklore and
religion in great secrecy. They do not trust the white man and none of the
English doctors have ever been able to find out just what they used to keep
their birth rate down... It's all very interesting and amusing, too, and Mr.
Kellogg can dramatize all this in an entertaining and fascinating way." (MS to
Gamble, Apr. 5, 1940 [<em>MSM</em> C7:71].)</p>
<p>Kellogg passed on a sample of the Fiji herb and instructions on its use to
Sanger, who wrote excitedly to Gamble in August, "Ive got herbs from Fiji
which are said to be used to prevent conception. Im hoping this may prove to be
the ‘magic pill' I've been hoping for since 1912 when women used to say
‘Do tell me the secret' ‘Cant I get some of the medicine too?'" (MS to
Gamble, Aug. 15, 1939 [<em>MSM</em> C6:1040].)</p>
<p>The "herb" in question was taken from what Kellogg called the Kakaula
plant – specifically the cambium, the layer of tissue between bark and wood,
scraped off and wrapped in a clean cloth. The bundle could then be briefly
immersed in water, squeezed into a small cup or basin, and consumed three times
a day to produce a state of sterility in females. ("Kakaula used to prevent
only conception," n. d., enclosure to Gamble to Randolph T. Major, Sept. 13,
1940 [<em>MSM</em> C7:128].)</p>
<p>Due to illness, both Sanger and Gamble were slow to act on the Fiji herb.
Both spent part of the fall of 1939 in the hospital; she suffered a bout of
pneumonia and he an ulcer attack. Gamble did make preliminary arrangements with
the Merck drug company for testing the herb, but Merck's labs required a
greater quantity to do a proper analysis, creating another delay while Kellogg
contacted Fiji for more Kakaula. He notified Sanger in December 1939 that he had
acquired a larger batch of the herb and was ready to send it on for testing.
Sanger was elated at the prospects: ". . . my joy is really unbounded, that
you have been able to get this material into the country. . . It is all
fascinating and inspiring and I do know if this turns out to be what we think a
reliable contraceptive and harmless, that it will be the answer to prayer for
millions of poor, down-trodden, over-burdened mothers, not only in this country
but throut the world." (MS to Kellogg, Dec. 17, 1939 [<em>MSM</em> C6:1089].)</p>
<p>While waiting for Merck to test the Kakaula, Sanger, Gamble and Kellogg
negotiated a patent agreement that would give Kellogg "some returns if returns
are to be had" so he could continue to sponsor young medical students in Fiji.
"All that Dr. Gamble and I want," Sanger wrote to Kellogg in February 1940,
"is to see if there is any basic ingredient in the herbs which will be a
preventive and if that can be marketed or distributed on a large scale thru a
high class chemical corporation." (MS to Kellogg, Feb. 12, 1940 [<em>MSM</em>
C7:47].)</p>
<p>Kellogg responded: "I feel quite confident the herbs will be a success,
although by a chemical synthesis I am not so sure. My Fijian medical student
thinks we will have to use it pure in order to be effective. I have brewed it
and have drunk some of it several times and I find it not at all unpleasant."
(Kellogg to MS, Feb. 21, 1940 [<em>MSM</em> C7:53].) He also clarified to Sanger
that he could not openly use any proceeds from potential sales of the herb to
support the medical school in Fiji as "No one in the school or in Fiji must
know one thing about the whole business. I have one source, and only one, for
getting the herb, in strictest secrecy from the boy and his mother. From them I
can obtain the whole plant and the leaves in quantities desired." Any profits
he would quietly funnel to the young medical student or use to pay for another
trip to Fiji. (Kellogg to MS, March 15, 1940 [<em>MSM</em> C7:60].)</p>
<p>Gamble clarified that a patent would cover only an extract isolated in the
laboratory; no one could have a claim on the plant itself. The rather premature
discussion of profits continued until Gamble wrote in May that he thought "the
chance of ultimate profits are rather small and relatively distant." On July
16 they came to a formal agreement with Merck, pending Merck's analysis of the
herb. (Gamble to Sanger and Kellogg, March 20 and May 23; Randolph T. Major,
Merck to Gamble, July 16, 1940 [<em>MSM</em> C7:63, 85, 104].)</p>
<p>Meanwhile Kellogg shared information with Sanger regarding other remedies he
had heard about while in Fiji, including an herbal abortifacient the island
natives called "stop." He later received a sample of powdered leaves from
what he called the Wakokono vine and sent it on to Sanger for testing. But
neither Sanger nor Gamble expressed much interest in an abortion herb, and
Gamble advised Kellogg to engage Merck or another interested company directly,
leaving him out of it. (MS to Gamble, Apr. 5 and Gamble to Kellogg Nov. 7, 1940
[<em>MSM</em> C7:71, 137].)</p>
<p>Early in 1941, Merck reported that animal tests found the herb to be harmless
but also ineffective. Merck requested that Kellogg furnish them with fresh
samples of the plant for additional testing, but the surviving correspondence
then ends abruptly. Merck does not allow outside researchers access to their
records, thus any reports on the Fiji herb, if still in existence, are
unavailable. Sanger's silence on the matter suggests that the Fiji herb turned
out to be a bust. (Gamble to Cecil Damon Wright, Feb. 15, 1941 [<em>MSM</em>
C7:189]; Gamble to Mary Lasker, Apr. 5, 1941 [Records of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, Sophia Smith Collection, Box 61].)</p>
<p>Kakaula may have been identical to the native Fijian plant Roqa that a
British medical officer stationed in Fiji wrote about in 1887 in the <em>Glasgow
Medical Journal</em>: "an amusing expedient. . . resorted to with the object of
preventing conception . . . sometimes successful and sometimes not." It could
have been a relative of Neem, a fast growing tree found in Fiji and many other
countries that for centuries has been used for cosmetic and medicinal purposes,
including contraception. In fact there were many contraceptive and abortifacient
herbs used by women in the South Pacific and studied in the 1930s. The aptly
named Dr. Hortense Powdermaker of Yale investigated numerous such remedies in
New Ireland, near the Fiji Islands, and wrote that the natives "think they
have a method of birth control. Certain leaves are supposed to have the power of
making a woman sterile, and others are said to have an abortive value. The
leaves are chewed, the juice swallowed, and the pulp spit out. Natives swear by
the efficacy of these leaves. But so also do they swear by the ability of the
rain magician to bring rain." She goes on to say that men zealously guarded
access to the herbs as they were an important source of income. Many other
so-called contraceptive plants were studied and tested in the 1940s and 1950s,
including Lithospermum, used by Native Americans in the Southwest, and a pea
extract, <em>Pisum Sativum</em>, which was found to contain fertility control
properties by researchers in India. (Both quotations from Norman E. Himes, <em>Medical
History of Contraception </em>[New York, 1936], 24-5; Abraham Stone, "Research
in Contraception: A Review and a Preview," in <em>Proceedings of the Third
International Conference on Planned Parenthood</em>, Nov. 24-29, 1952 [Bombay,
India], 101.)</p>
<p>If the Fiji herb turned out to be little more than a good story, what
accounted for the ability of Fijians to control their family size? The very
notion of smaller families in Fiji relative to other islands could have been
largely based on anecdote and very unscientific observation. More likely Fijians
were practicing other forms of birth control, whether or not the Fiji herb got
the ultimate credit. A. B. Brewster, another British official in Fiji, wrote in
his 1922 account of his forty year tenure in Fiji that mothers nursed their
children up to ages five and six. It was also custom that husbands would refrain
from intercourse for three or four years after the birth of a child. He noted
too that there were a large number of infant deaths. (A. B. Brewster, <em>The
Hill Tribes of Fiji </em>[London, 1922], 189.)</p>
<p>The failure of the Fiji herb to work its magic in a laboratory, like the
failure of researchers to replicate successful spermatoxin trials, and many
other dead ends in the quest for new contraceptives, added to Sanger's
decades-long frustration over finding a more suitable female-controlled method
than the diaphragm. But these set-backs never inhibited her drive to find the
"magic pill" she spoke of some twenty years before it came to fruition.</p>
