        <h1>BIRTH CONTROL STEPS OUT</h1>
        <h2>A NOTE ON THE SENATE HEARING</h2>
        <h3>By MARGARET SANGER</h3>
        <p>The essential object of the Committee on
                Federal Legislation for Birth Control in presenting the bill S. 4582, was to amend the federal laws so that motherhood shall be conscious
            and controlled. This was the first time such a bill had been introduced and this bill as
            presented by our Chairman Senator Gillett may
            yet be the future foundation of The Mother&#8217;s Bill of Rights.</p>
        <p>We want mothers to have proper scientific instruction through the channels of the medical
            profession which will enable them to control the size of the family.</p>
        <p>We want them to have such knowledge that they may space the period between the births of
            children in consideration of the mother&#8217;s health, the father&#8217;s earning capacity and the
            future welfare of the child.</p>
        <p>We want parenthood to be regarded as something beyond and above a casual accident or a
            punishment as a result of shiftlessness and recklessness.</p>
        <p>Parenthood when it is responsible can be a noble trust or a proud commission--an honored
            assignment-- and this can be accomplished only by taking it out of the sphere of
            accident and placing it in the sphere of conscious responsibility.</p>
        <p>The laws that this bill S.4582 will amend have classed the information relating to the
            prevention of conception with obscenity, pornography, indecency and abortion; such
            information does not belong there.</p>
        <p>Section 211 was
            passed by Congress in 1873. At that time there
            was very little known regarding the subject, the technique of contraception, but in
            spite of these laws there has been a gradual awakening as to its need and necessity for
            more complete information. These laws make no exception for medical societies, medical
            schools, journals, reprints or books or a scientific character. These laws make no
            exception to physicians in their regular practice, nor for hospitals or clinics, nor for
            the patients of such doctors; nor for any of the other organizations, so necessary for
            the proper distribution of medical supplies.</p>
        <p>These laws interfere with the publication of authorized scientific and medical books, for
            no publisher will risk or jeopardize his freedom in the publication of any book where
            there is a law against its circulation.</p>
        <p>The laws interfere with the importation of articles of research and reports from clinics
            of other countries which would gradually advance the knowledge of the medical profession
            in this country on this subject. The medical schools are unable today to obtain
            scientific data from other universities or from laboratories or from scientific research
            going on in other parts of the world.</p>
        <p>These laws interfere with the proper dissemination of this information in many states of
            the Union where there are laws enabling the physicians to give such advice within their
            own states. There are today in this country over fifty legally established, medically
            directed birth control clinics especially designed for the purpose of instructing
            patients who are entitled to receive such instruction under the law of the state in
            which they reside. These clinics are distributed throughout twelve states, and this law,
            section 211, makes it a crime for me or for anyone to send to a mother or sister or
            relative, poor or diseased as she may be, the address of any of those clinics, several
            of which may be operating legally in her own state.</p>
        <p>This law interferes with the transportation of supplies from the manufacturer to the
            clinics, or from the retail druggist to the doctors operating in their respective
            states. No one is enabled to send the address of these clinics to anyone else except in
            violation of the federal law.</p>
        <p>Our annual reports covering the work of these clinics carrying data regarding the effect
            of contraception or describing the articles used by the patients cannot be sent to
            doctors or to other clinics without a violation of the law.</p>
        <p>The bill that was introduced and upon which the committee has not yet acted, requests
            that certain exceptions be made in this law.</p>
        <p>We ask that the section shall not apply to information when published within or without
            the United States by any governmental
            agency, medical society, medical school or medical journal, nor to reprints after any
            such publication.</p>
        <p>We ask that it shall not apply to any licensed physician or hospital or clinic when sent
            by them to any other physician, hospital or clinic. We ask that it shall not apply to
            anyone who may send the name and address of any physician, hospital, or clinic, where
            such advice is legally given.</p>
        <p>We also ask that it shall not apply to any of the articles that may be used for this
            purpose when sent by wholesale or retail dealers in medical supplies to the physicians,
            hospitals or clinics, or when sent by a physician to any of his patients.</p>
        <p>This bill as presented is conservative, logical and constructive.</p>
        <p>There is nothing in this bill which we ask of Congress which compels the use of
            contraception by any individual or group which may for religious or other personal
            reasons object to it. There is nothing compelling anyone to use such information but we
            do ask the member of Congress to give to millions of mothers who desire it throughout
            the country the right to have proper scientific information through the proper channels
            by qualified medical persons.</p>
        <p>We want no wholesome distribution of indecency nor pornography. We leave the law exactly
            as it was except we remove the subject of prevention of conception from it and place it
            in the hands of the medical profession where it rightly belongs.</p>
        <p>Most of us believe that the original object of these laws was to prevent the
            dissemination of pornographical literature through the United States mails and to
            restrict its entrance into this country at a time when little was known about scientific
            contraception. We fully concur in this restriction.</p>
        <p>We believe, however, that to place medical or scientific information or literature in
            this class is unjust, unfair to the inhabitants of this country; that it places a great
            hardship upon the future progress and achievements of our welfare activities.</p>
        <p>The effect of keeping this law on the statue books is to increase surreptitious, harmful,
            unscientific information which increases crime, multiplying abortions.</p>
        <p>This law in effect has already been responsible directly and indirectly for the deaths of
            approximately one million mothers and for the deaths of fifteen millions of children
            many of whom were born unwanted and in conditions of hardship, poverty, cruelty, and
            disease.</p>
        <p>The effect of keeping this law on our statue books is to keep alive hypocrisy, evasion,
            and increase a general disregard for laws.</p>
        <p>There is nothing to be gained by keeping on the statue books laws that are known to be
            inimical to personal health, family happiness and racial development.</p>
