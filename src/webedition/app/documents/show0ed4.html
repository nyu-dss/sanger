        <h1>Frederick Nietzsche.</h1>
        <p>The powerful mind of Nietzsche has exerted an
            influence in Europe which has made itself felt in all philosophy &amp;
            letters of the past ten years.</p>
        <p>His gospel of life has awakened new channels of thought in other writers &amp; preached
            under the forceful, vigorous forum of aphorisms has broken loose from the dogmatic
            travels school which had dominated the world of Western thought since Kant.</p>
        <p>The philosophy of Nietzsche has attracted attention in literary circles in
                France
            England
            America besides giving birth to literature abundant
            in quantity &amp; varying in quality in Germany.</p>
        <p>It is to me regrettable that such interest in 
        [<em>him</em>]
     seems
            to remain outside the reach of the workers--for whom it is intended. Nietzsche
            philosophy not only calls in question the moral law itself it challenges &amp; attacks
            the foundation of all moral law. Before this almost all schools of philosophy had been
            agreed upon the fact that a universal moral law exists.</p>
        <p>Max Stirner was perhaps the first to deny the
            existence of it &amp; preach the gospel of immoralism but Stirners name remains almost
            unknown to us.</p>
        <p>But in Nietzsche lyrical enthusiasm in Zarathrustra he first
            called general attention to the fact that serious reasons exist for preferring the
            immoral to the moral--the untrue to the true.</p>
        <p>Perhaps no where thru N-- philosophy can it be felt that he intended to deduce any
            sociological conclusions from his philosophy, rather did mean it as an expression of
                <span class="del">his</span>
            
       &#8593;a&#8595;
     personality, 
       &#8593;a&#8595;
     character &amp; of a temperament-- But
            nevertheless we have a right to extract from this or any philosophy that which we can
            use for our own purpose &amp; so I claim 
        [<em>the</em>?]
     right of the worker to
            deduce 
        [<em>in</em>?]
     Nietzsches philosophy as much as they can use for their
            own.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to apply his philosophy of Nietzsche or to study or know him before
            first getting an insight into the tremendous personality which so strongly reveals
            itself through every line of his work in every aphorism of his mind.</p>
        <p>Sincerity &amp; heroism are the two characteristics of Nietzsches personality and a third
            may be added a delicacy of sentiment &amp; refinement. These characteristics give us a
            clue to his rupture with his once dearest friend Wagner. They give us a clue to his
            hatred of the democratic &amp; plebian movement to his hatred of the Christian religion.
                "All or nothing" was his motto &amp; he lived up to it.</p>
        <p>As one of his biographers (Hill) has said
            of him</p>
        <p>
            "Gifted with an extraordinary refinement of sentiment &amp; taste; having
                set himself as an ideal Life itself, &amp; Life in beauty, in plentitude, in power
                in exuberance of wealth; he was determined to be sincere with himself
                    
        [<em>at</em>?]
     all &amp; every cost, to examine every ideal, however
                ancient, however sacred its traditions, however universal its acceptance; to examine
                it to the bottom, to reject it if necessary at what ever cost of friendship or of
                suffering to himself; to affirm &amp; reaffirm his ideal, that ideal which he held
                to be true; to affirm &amp; reaffirm in the face of the whole world if necessary,
                without compromise.
        </p>
        <p>To be able to do this--to be able to attack &amp; reject all that which
                mankind has hitherto by almost universal acceptance, held sacred to be able to
                sacrifice all these ideas which tradition &amp; education have rendered personally
                of value to be able to sacrifice friends that one loves &amp; venerates on the altar
                of ones convictions--to do this requires courage above the ordinary--it requires
                heroism."</p>
        <p>His refinement of taste his third great characteristic can not be submerged by the two
            other traits. He is essentially an artist. Some think him more an artist than a thinker
            or rather that his career as thinker is subordinated to his artistic properties-- He
            wrote poetry it is true he also loved music &amp; composed some, but greater &amp; more
            important than these was the fact that his whole conception of life was an artistic
                <span class="del">production</span> conception.</p>
        <p>He was born in 1844 at Richen in Germany. </p>
        <p>I am not going into detail with the incidents of his biography only to relate here &amp;
            there in passing the events which influenced his life.</p>
        <p>As his father was a protestant pastor he naturally was brought up in a religious
            atmosphere. Th'o it was neither bigoted nor austere.</p>
        <p>Its interesting to note in passing that 
       &#8593;the&#8595;
     Nietzsche who hated Christianity
            &amp; broke away from its chains, that he bitterly attacked the faith of his
            forefathers. He who proclaimed in all places &amp; at all times that "God was dead" that he was beyond &amp; above all
            religion &amp; supernatural belief--yet by his great worship of truth by his
            idealization of life his fearless &amp; intrepid sincerity that he was really activated
            by the deepest religious principles.</p>
        <p>He was far above Churches &amp; religion yet he believed in life, in life as a
            manifestation of Beauty he believed in principles &amp; lived up to his principles.</p>
        <p>His study of Greek did more than anything else to reveal Nietzsche to himself.</p>
        <p>Already many writers might be named who owe if not half their ideas, at least half their
            courage to their ideas to Nietzsche. No other man is more representative of the spirit
            of his age (Emerson, Blake, Ibsen--) he was his age for he understood the mind of
            Europe.</p>
        <p>Its significant that his main attack should be leveled against the foundations of
            European morality. The greatest immoralist the modern world has seen--he needed the
            dynamic qualities he possessed to stand alone against a continent &amp; a tradition of
            2000 years.</p>
        <p>Passion the characteristic of his thought, Birth of Tragedy,
            his first book. No bombast--no out pouring of big words to cover up little ideas.</p>
        <p>The greatest events he says are <span class="del">our</span> greatest thoughts--the product of our
            stillest hour.</p>
        <p>"The secret of a joyful life is to live dangerously."</p>
        <p>
            Throw not away the hero in thy soul.
        </p>
        <p>What is bad? all that proceeds from weakness. (Beyond Good
                &amp; Evil)</p>
        <p>Ascending &amp; descending character. The need of salvation--is the sincerest form of
            expression of decadence.</p>
        <p>Nietzsche sees the world becoming peopled with a ludicrous species--a tame, obliging
            sickly, mediocre kind of gently--grunting domestic animal.</p>
        <p>What is good?--all that elevates the feeling of power--</p>
        <p>What is bad? All that proceeds from weakness.</p>
        <p>What is happiness? The feeling that power increases--that resistance is being
            overcome.</p>
        <p>Philosophers have never dared to cast doubt upon the lawfulness of moral judgements--but
            it is Nietzsche who dares to declare war on all morals, mans instincts etc.</p>
        <p>"There is a morality of Master &amp; a Morality of Slaves-- Moral values
                have been determined either by a race of masters, conscious &amp; proud of the
                distance that separates them from the ruled race--or by a crowd of subjegated ones,
                slaves, inferiors of all kinds." page 120 Gospel.</p>
        <p>Man must retain all the knowledge aptitudes &amp; new strength acquired in
                the course of his long &amp; painful experience but he must break up the 
       &#8593;tablet
                    of&#8595;
     laws which at present hinder him in his march forward--he must renounce
                the present historical values, the Christian, democratic, ascetic ideal, &amp;
                create Master values of his own. page 174 Gospel.</p>
        <p>Power of laughter (a secret unknown) page 204 -- "Free dost thou call
                thyself."</p>
        <p>Nietzsche--what he taught the worker</p>
        <p><span class="underline">His teachings.</span></p>
        <p>1st a teacher of Eternal recurrences Everything repeats itself, life, earth, solar
            system.</p>
        <p>2nd He applied the principle of evolution to the extant system of morals.</p>
        <p>3 He tried to trace the origin of our present day morals, &amp; found that we must create
            a new ethics which are beyond good &amp; evil.</p>
        <p>4. He attacked the 
       &#8593;morality of&#8595;
     Christianity perhaps more vigorously than any
            previous writer (Voltaire). He
            claims it teaches a slave morality &amp; teaches a Master morality is higher to aim at.
            Yea to life in its fullness &amp; all that is high, beautiful &amp; daring.</p>
        <p>Schopenhauer his 
       &#8593;first&#8595;
     great
            teacher. He found a book &amp; read it &amp; became charmed &amp; captivated, a devoted
            follower personality &amp; his teachings.</p>
        <p>One can scarcely separate a mans personality from his life--neither can we separate it
            from his teachings.</p>
        <p>As a Philosopher--the government has always tended to capture &amp; employ the
            Philosopher of its age, but what State would patronise Plato or
            Schopenhauer.</p>
        <p>When you get to the Library get some of the works on Nietzsche-- You will understand the
            coming generation and what is in the air today when you have read &amp; grasped his
            philosophy--for instance his liking our civilization (?) and character into three
            stages--the camel--the lion &amp; the child.</p>
        <p>The camel takes all the heavy loads &amp; burdens &amp; goes into the wilderness where he
            dwells in solitude &amp; loneliness, but the weight of the burdens strengthens him &amp;
            he becomes a lion &amp; as Nietzsche says a "laughing lion"-- &amp;
                "freedom it will take as its prey &amp; be lord in its own
                wilderness."</p>
        <p>"To create freedom for ones self--and a holy
                        
        [<em>
        [<em>[illegible]</em>]
    </em>?]
     even towards duty;--for
                this my heathern, there is need of a lion." </p>
        <p>Again "a sense of truth in a sense of security."</p>
        <p>Attraction &amp; repulsion, reason &amp; energy love &amp; hate are necessary to human
            existence.</p>
        <p>From these contraries come what is called good &amp; evil.</p>
        <p>Good is the passive that obeys reason evil is the active springing from energy. Good is
            Heaven, Evil is Hell.</p>
        <p>Those who restrain desire do so because the desire is weak enough to be restrained.
            Reason usurps its place &amp; governs the weak &amp; unwilling. And being restrained, it
            by degrees becomes passive till it is only the shadow of desire.</p>
        <p>
            Prudence is a rich old maid courted by incapacity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fox condemns the trap--not himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exuberance is Beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sooner murder an infant in the cradle than nurse unacted desires.
        </p>
        <p>
            I must create a system or be enslaved by another mans. I will not reason
                &amp; compare my business is to create.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chains are the cunning of weak &amp; timid 
       &#8593;tame&#8595;
     minds.
        </p>
        <p>
            These two Classes of men are always upon the Earth. They should be
                enemies whoever tries to reconcile them seeks to destroy their existence. Religion
                is an endeavor to reconcile the two.
        </p>
        <p>
            The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water &amp; breeds
                reptiles of the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            The significance of the individual--
        [<em>the
                    significance</em>]
     of the consciousness of the ind. First that the
                individual is the original source &amp; constituent of all value. No other standard
                of obligations for you or for me than that set by our personal ends &amp;
                ideals.
        </p>
        <p>"The triumph of life! The great yea to all things high beautiful,
                daring"! </p>
        <p>"No one knoweth yet what is good &amp; evil."</p>
        <p>What a shock these words must have given Europe--Europe with its priestcraft popery &amp;
            Culture-- No wonder indeed that the man who dared to thunder out the above words was
            considered a madman--good &amp; evil--did not Europe know what it was.</p>
        <p>Two lessons to be learned from Nietzsche--to understand Aristocracy &amp; to acquire a
            subtle method of thinking.</p>
        <p>His love of music was strong in him at an early age.</p>
