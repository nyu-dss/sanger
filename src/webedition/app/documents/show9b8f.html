        <h1>Birth Control</h1>
        <p>A movement to limit the number of offspring in the family. It dates back to Thomas Malthus, an English clergyman, who in his
            essay on population in 1798 advocated population control through moral restraint as a
            social method. A neo-Malthusian, Francis Place, in
            his Illustrations and Proofs of the Principle of Population, 1822, new
            ed., 1930, held that moral restraint is not enough and advocated "preventives." Richard Carlile in
                England published his Every Woman's Book, 1826, the
            first book in English exclusively on contraception, both in theory and in practice.
                Robert Dale Owen in 1831 published his
                Moral Physiology which advocated and described methods of
            contraception, but the first publication by an American physician was The Fruits
                of Philosophy by Charles L.
                Knowlton, 1832, new ed., 1937. Forty years later the Neo-Malthusian League of England was started as a
            purely educational movement.</p>
        <p>In 1914 the words "birth control" came into use, when Margaret Sanger, a trained nurse, aroused to the need for information of
            contraceptive methods among the poor with whom she worked, began a national campaign of
            education, agitation, and organization. Publication of an article on "The
                Prevention of Conception" in the monthly magazine, The Woman
                Rebel, which she sponsored, led to her indictment under federal law. The
            indictment was dropped in 1916 and that year Mrs. Sanger and her sister Ethel Byrne, another trained nurse, opened the first
            control clinic in America, in one of the poorest
            sections of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>They were both arrested and served workhouse terms for "maintaining a public nuisance."
            The case was appealed and a decision handed down by the Appellate Division of the
                New York State Supreme Court in 1918 established the legal right of physicians
            in the state to advise on contraception "for the cure or prevention of disease"-a great
            legal victory.</p>
        <p>The <span class="italics">Birth Control Review</span> began publication in 1917 and was
            issued until 1940.Continuous organization resulted in the formation of the American
                Birth Control League in 1921, and of numerous state and local organizations
            later. Interest in the movement was widespread. Magazines, pamphlets, literature
            covering all angles of the problems, and lectures were effective as propaganda, and
            newspaper publicity which accompanied efforts to stop the movement by interference with
            the constitutional right of free speech, or by arrests of prominent people, all gave
            great impetus to the cause and advertised its theories.</p>
        <p>A second national organization, The Voluntary Parenthood League, was formed in
            1919, and attempted to change the Federal laws on contraception, but has been inactive
            of recent years.</p>
        <p>In 1923 the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau was opened in New York by Mrs. Sanger, with a woman physician as clinician. The growth of clinics
            continued and in June, 1942, they totaled 805, covering all but four states and
            extending into Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico,
            and the Virgin Islands--with 225 in hospitals, 262 in health department
            quarters, and 352 supported wholly or in part by public funds. Three states, North and South Carolina and
                Alabama had included child spacing in the programs of their state
            departments of health by 1941.</p>
        <p>Support for the movement through endorsement of over 1000 organizations, largely the
            result of the work of the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
                Control, organized by Mrs. Sanger in 1929, resulted in action. Every poll of
            public opinion has shown a favorable majority. National and international converences
            have accentuated the growth of the movement. Action of the American Medical
                Association, through its Committee to Study Contraceptive Practices and
                Allied Problems in 1937, which accepted birth control as "desirable for the health and well-being of mothers and children" and
            recommended that the A.M.A. promote
            instruction in contraception in the medical schools, was a great step forward. This
            followed the decision of the United States Circuit Court of appeals for the Second
                Circuit in the case of U.S. vs. One Package, which stated that
            the design of the section of the Federal law, on which the suit was based, was "not to
            prevent the importation, sale, or carriage by mail of things which might intelligently
            be employed by conscientious and competent physicians for the purpose of saving life or
            promoting the well-being of their patients."</p>
        <p>In 1939 Birth Control Federation of America, Inc., was formed by a merger of
            the American Birth Control Leage and the Birth Control Clinical Research Burea, and in
            1942 the organization, at its annual meeting changed its name to the Planned
                Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., as more expressive of its aims and
            purposes. These had grown to include treatment for infertility and education for
            marriage and parenthood. An increasing number of local planned parenthood organizations
            were offering expert medical help to childless couples who desire children, or were able
            to refer these couples to hospitals and private physicians for diagnosis and
            treatment.</p>
        <p>The first post-war international sex conference was held in Stockholm in August, 1946, with the United States
            among the countries which were represented unofficially to discus the problems raised by
            the crowded populations of the world. Resolutions endorsing planned parenthood
            objectives in strong terms were adopted.</p>
