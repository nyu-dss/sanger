        <p>I wonder how many of you here tonight realize just how significant this gathering really
            is? How many of you realize that this meeting of intelligent, representative citizens
            brought together by an interest in birth control represents ten years of struggle and
            effort. <span class="underline">Ten years</span>: Ten years of battling against ignorance
            and predjuice. A ten year fight for the right to get people to talk and to think about
            the greatest problem that confronts the human race.</p>
        <p>For there are few subjects which have so large a practical significance and at the same
            time cut so deeply into the foundations of social evolution as birth control.</p>
        <p>There are few other questions of equal importance left so long in equal obscurity and yet
            none perhaps which can show so unequalled a leap in our social vista as birth control
            has done in so brief a period of time.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago to utter the words was looked upon as a crime. To champion the right of
            millions and millions of enslaved mothers meant an inditment. the whole subject was
            taboo. It was almost a crime to think of the words.</p>
        <p>Even three years ago as you most you remember, a meeting at the town hall was illegally
            broken up at the instigation of our enemies. We have had to fight every inch of the way.
            We have had to fight for peaceable and serious discussions of this momentous subject.
            Tonight the very fact that we are permitted to assemble here unmollested is in itself a
            great victory.</p>
        <p>There are two fundamental reasons for the popular and growing interest in birth control
            and these are:</p>
        <p class="blockquote">That civilization is confronted with two serious problems.</p>
        <p class="blockquote">That of the pressure of population upon the food supply.</p>
        <p class="blockquote">That of reconciling humanisation with race improvement.</p>
        <p class="blockquote">Many of believe that birth control is the key to them both.</p>
        <p>Mark Twain said. &#8220;Everybody talks about
                the weather but no one ever seems to <span class="del">ever</span> do any thing about it.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Well, the American Birth Control League has been, and is, doing something
            about these problems.</p>
        <p>We know that words, theories, setiments and sympathies are all very good in themselves
            but we have got to have intelligent thinking and put it into intelligent action.</p>
        <p>If the program for birth control is to grow, to expand, if it is even to hold the ground
            it has gained thru these years of untold sacrifice, of often seemingly hopeless effort
            we must have cooperation. We must have courageous active cooperation. Not alone of
            individuals but of organizations and of those who accept the truth of birth control --
            but do nothing about it.</p>
        <p>We need more English courage injected in the intellectual life of America. We need the
            kind of intellectual courage such as has been shown by Dean Inge, Bernard
                Shaw, H. G. Wells, John Maynard Keynes and Lord Dawson of Penn, the king&#8217;s physician. These men have
            had the courage to publicly express their private convictions. They have never lost in
            the estimation of the British public by so doing.</p>
        <p>The American Birth Control League is calling for the cooperation of the medical
            profession, for scientific research, for investigation and unbiased study. We continue
            to point out how birth control is the very pivot of all social problems - - problems of
            child welfare as well as of national health.</p>
        <p>We are trying to make the world safe for babies. We insist that sympathy, charity,
            pallative legislation is not enough. That milk stations are not enough. That maternity
            centers are not enough. That child labor laws are not enough.</p>
        <p>If you could look into the faces of some of the parents whose children labor laws are
            trying to protect you would see that they are not enough. You would see that such
            parents has not sufficient earning power to provide for their own existence to say
            nothing of providing for the eight or ten children that they have already borne. When
            children are born of such parents and under such conditions neccesity forces them to
            work as soon as they can toddle -- or to die. Child labor laws are not enough and
            children of such parents should never be born.</p>
        <p>Societies for the prevention of cruelty to children are not enough. We want to prevent
            the cruelty of children being born in cruelty. Could anything be more cruel than to be
            born in disease, ignorance, misery.</p>
        <p>If we are to make this world safe for childhood, safe for future generations, safe for
            civilization we have got to check the endless stream of unwanted death doomed children.
            This stream can not be swept back with the broom of pallative legislation -- nor with
            the feather duster of organised charity. It must be checked at the source by birth
            control.</p>
