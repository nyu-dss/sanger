        <h1>Facing the New Year</h1>
        <p>No year has been more eventful, more crowded with drama and significance than the twelve
            months just finished. The first American Birth Control conference; the
            illegal breaking up of the Town Hall meeting and our subsequent exposure of the powers
            of darkness; our triumphant completion of the meeting in the Park Theatre; our
            successful incorporation of the American Birth Control League; the increasing
            support and championship of Birth Control by the finest contemporary intellects of the
            world; the organization of State leagues and the awakening of public interest in this
            profound and immediate problem--such are only a few of the events that should inspire us
            to new and increased endeavor. The year 1922 also marks the successful circling of the
            globe by the doctrine of Birth Control. Despite the efforts at suppression by the
            Imperial Japanese government, Margaret Sanger was warmly greeted in the
            leading cities of the island empire; and the Birth Control movement has struck roots in
            the land of the Mikado. We should also mention the dignified conference
            held in  London last July, and the adhesion to our
            movement of so distinguished a figure as that brilliant economist John Maynard
                Keynes. But if we have succeeded in impressing public opinion, in awakening
            interest, we face at the beginning of 1923 great difficulties.</p>
        <p>The year 1922 marked for us the renewed efforts of our arch-enemies to hinder the
            progress of enlightenment. The seat of this opposition is to be found in the Roman
                Catholic Church. This enemy is ceaselessly active and openly determined to
            exterminate the Birth Control movement in America. The incident of the Town Hall meeting illustrates the extent our
            opponents may go. The  Cincinnati episode, recounted
            elsewhere in this issue, shows the attempt of the Roman Catholic Church and such
            subsidiary bodies as the Knights of Columbus, to use the weapon of boycott to
            stop the progress of Birth Control. Last month we invited our enemies to come out into
            the open. The Knights of Columbus threatened the managers of the Hotel Gibson with the
            cancellation of their annual banquet, if they permitted the use of the Hotel Gibson
            ballroom for the Birth Control conferences. To the everlasting credit of the managers of
            the hotel and the  Mayor of Cincinnati, they stood firm.
            They upheld the law and the Constitution. They refused to be intimidated by this
            blustering mob, directed by the wily directors of Church politics. The conference was
            held, the Knights of Columbus banquet was cancelled. Let us not fail to record here our
            deep gratitude and appreciation for this noble support of the sacred American traditions
            of free speech and free thought. Cincinnati is to be congratulated for the fine courage
            and steadfastness of her mayor, her citizens, and the management of the Hotel Gibson, in
            resisting the threats of the Catholic machine. Our movement is an educational one in
            more ways than one.</p>
        <p>Our handicaps are great. They seem greater than ever before. We have the equipment for
            the greatest single movement on the earth--almost. No one can deny that we have the
            vision, the fighting energy, an ever-growing knowledge of the cause from its scientific
            and practical aspects. Every day we are receiving letters of encouragement from the most
            enlightened men and women in every country. We have workers eager to dedicate their
            lives to the movement. We have the support of the best authorities in the fields of
            social service, of the churches and of scientific research. There seems in truth only
            one aspect in which we are weak, and in that so deplorably weak that our hopes seem
            impossible of realization. <span class="italics"> We have no definite and dependable
                financial resources.</span> Without this foundation we cannot continue our fight.
            Our workers should have some assurance that they are supported by enlightened public
            opinion. They should be relieved of the ignoble task of collecting penny by penny. This
            burden at least should not be heavy upon the shoulders of those who are on the fighting
            front. In this war for <span class="italics">true civilization</span> we should stand
            back of our little army of the vanguard. Vague purposeless charities are generously
            supported; philanthropic schemes get millions from intelligent Americans. This great
            experiment, this effort to educate the educators, which is now gradually bearing fruit,
            is assumed to be able to live on nothing a year. Years of study, research, labor and
            sacrifice have gone into the effort to crystallize the Birth Control movement. We are
            just successfully beginning to penetrate the social consciousness of our age. Our effort
            to accomplish this is absolutely dependent upon financial support. People buy pictures
            racehorses, aeroplanes and motor cars. They support charities, museums, schools, the
            opera. They are interested in breeding thoroughbred live stock. Why are they so little
            interested in our effort to improve the human stock, to introduce efficiency, health and
            nobility into the coming generations? Here is the great experiment, the most fascinating
            of all, the most important of all social efforts to bring order out of chaos, the most
            interesting and exciting fashion, in short, to create the future civilization of America
            and of the world! The line for millionaires forms at the right. Step forward please!</p>
