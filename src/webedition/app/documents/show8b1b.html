		<h1>
			
        [<em>Excerpt from "Support
					for Birth Control"</em>]
    
		</h1>
		<h2>A Warm Welcome</h2>
		
			<p>Mrs. Sanger, the last speaker, whose appearance
					after her long absence was greeted with great enthusiasm by
					the audience which filled every seat in the large hall, took
					occasion to thank the Board of Directors of the
						American Birth Control League, and especially
					the acting president, Mrs. F. Robertson Jones, for their faithful
					work and practical accomplishments both in finances and
					increase of membership during her absence. In her address
					she summarized the progress of Birth Control in
						England and Germany and
					sketched the international situation in its bearings on
					America and the other countries now throwing up barriers
					against immigration. She asked "if certain classes are
				undesireable as immigrants from the outside why is not the same
				logic used by the United States to prevent them
				from being added to the population on the inside?"</p>
			<p>"This morning's press"  she continued, "gave an
				estimate that the population of this country is now 120
				millions. In the glory of increasing population, we must
				recognize that numbers are not the only thing to consider.
				Individuals are not mere statistical units who are born, marry
				and die, and, while these functions cannot be entirely ignored,
				there is a value depending on the quality of the material with
				which they are endowed through inheritance. This is of
				infinitely greater importance to society and to the progress of
				the race than mere numbers.</p>
		
		
			<h2>Mrs. Sanger on Population</h2>
			<p>Science is now bordering on the infinite and the most powerful
				brain seems feeble in the face of tasks which are glimpsed. If
				one is to judge by the present predicament of the world, we may
				assume that there is no individual nor group whose intelligence
				is equal to the tasks that the international situation demands.
				It seems almost as if the knowledge required exceeds our
				capacity for understanding.</p>
			<p>It is to the science of population that we must now look for
				future guidance. It must point the way for population regulation
				which in this country, in particular, could soon deliver society
				from more than half of its terrific burdens. It could soon help
				us to eliminate the possibility of increasing dysgenic stocks,
				such as those with inherited or transmissible diseases. It could
				soon lessen the burden of philanthropic demands which are fast
				growing beyond the cultural needs of this generation. Sane
				legislation would indirectly direct reproduction towards
				adaptation to future conditions by raising the mean level of
				brain power. The importance of numbers belongs to the past
				rather than to the future.</p>
			<p>The needs of manual labor in the future will be greatly reduced
				by the progress of chemistry, physics and the possession of
				unlimited sources of heat and force at a minimum of expenditure.
				On the other hand, we shall need brains highly resistant to work
				and capable of a degree of education surpassing that of the most
				intelligent skilled artisan today. Vaster memories must be
				forged, sharper insight must be gained and with the discovery of
				the laws of inheritance men can choose whether we shall evolve
				to the expression of the highest within us, or revert to the
				stage of the barbarian. It is for man to decide.</p>
			<p>With all the knowledge that we today posses, it is obvious that
				it is a crime for generations to come, it is a crime against our
				civilization to encourage the reproduction of mediocre, diseased
				or inferior types of groups. Such offspring can only be a burden
				to the future and retard the progress of the present
				generation.</p>
			<p>It has become clear that the population of the earth is fast
				arriving at its possible maximum; that its density is badly
				distributed; that redistribution of space can only be rectified
				by displacements; and that Birth Control in overpopulated
				countries is the first and surest method whereby the balance may
				be peacefully restored.</p>

				away, so as to want the pleasure of coming back.</p>

			<h1>
				
        [<em>From Partial Typed Speech</em>]
    
			</h1>
			<p> It has long been hoped by some of us that a sound international
				population program might be advanced. We have seen that manuala
				broader bird&#8217;s eye view of the problem was necessary if it was
				to fit international and modern conditions. It was quite natural
				that the militarist should look upon the subject only with a
				view of armies; the demographer with the number of births,
				deaths, marriages in a given city, country over a given
				period.</p>
			<p>The anthropologist is concerned with the division into races
				within a population, especially in respect to their adaptability
				and the effect of social selection and colonization, while the
				economist, biologist and statistician--each expert in his own
				line--was bound to propose measures according to the limits of
				his inquiries; consequently, formidable errors were bound to
				arise when it came to practical issues.</p>
			<p>It was with this in mind that I went to Europe for the objects of
				bringing together scientists from various countries of different
				departments to correlate their views, experiments and programs,
				and to establish, if possible, a permanent organization for
				further studies and research along population lies.</p>
			<p>This Population Union has now been launched and it is
				hoped that there will be a recognition through their studies of
				the fact that there can be no solution to the population problem
				without the recognition of the human factors which make this
				problem. I refer to the parents who produce populations--and
				especially the mothers who bear and rear the children.</p>
			<p>The intelligent thinkers in Europe, many with whom I had
				conversed, believe that the empty spaces on the globe are
				becoming rare; that populations are so increasing in every
				country that governments are at a loss to know how to deal with
				the problems arising therefrom; that Europe is today faced with
				a problem of having more men than bread, and this problem has
				become acute, because of the attitude of the United States,
				Australia and Canada in their recent immigration
				legislation.</p>
			<p>It is now recognized that each country needs its own available
				food supply. Each country is guarding its own labor market,
				fearing unrest, unemployment and revolution. Soon every nation
				will reserve its potential resources for its own people, and
				already most of the European countries have overdrawn on their
				margin of self-sufficiency. Germany, Italy, Poland and all the
				central European countries should be encouraged to limit their
				population to their natural resources, but they are all dreaming
				of colonization, for colonization over seas was the solution of
				overpopulated Europe since the conquest of the Atlantic.</p>
			<p>There is no doubt that this has made civilization almost
				worldwide, and yet, there are doubts that this solution was of
				permanent value, for we now see that economic greed caused
				nations to overlook fundamental principles, and the future
				potentialities of nations have been sacrificed for immediate
				gain.</p>
			<p>Colonial expansion is still the dream of those militarists who
				clamor for big battalions of babies, and we see from the past
				that colonization has aroused a hatred of peaceful nations
				against the white race, and everywhere in Asia is
				the growing determination to free themselves from their
				political domination.</p>
			<p>Immigration legislation in the United States has caused much
				bitterness in Europe, for there is current a feeling that
				various nations have expended through generations much of their
				most valuable human material in order to furnish America with
				ready-made workmen--skilled in the arts and crafts--thereby
				impoverishing herself of valuable stocks, with the obvious
				results of creating a rival, today more powerful than all of
				Europe combined.</p>
			<p>America, on the other hand, considers that she has been
				overstocked with undesirable elements; that her dream of the
				melting-pot of assimilating the various races, colors, grades of
				mentalities through education by an American type of
				intelligence, has not succeeded. She now regrets her mistake,
				and has established a rigid system of immigration barriers for
				her own national and racial protection; and one can assume that
				from the Immigration Act of 1924, the
					United States Government recognizes that there is
				a population problem in this country; that the resources of the
				land are limited; that unrestricted population increase through
				unrestricted immigration is bound to invite disaster to the
				social and racial life of the country. Consequently, a bar is
				raised to the free entrance of aliens into the United States,
				and even, when by the quota such aliens are given permission to
				enter the country, there are still social considerations to be
				grappled with.</p>
			<p>The government claims the right to exclude immigrants whose
				condition is likely to be a source of danger to the well-being
				and happiness of the country. Thus there are excluded all
				idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded persons, epileptics, insane
				persons, persons of psychopathic inferiority, persons afflicted
				with tuberculosis in any form, or with any loathsome, dangerous
				or contagious disease, paupers, professional beggars, vagabonds,
				persons likely to become a public charge, polygamists,
				anarchists, criminals, prostitutes, or persons coming to U.S.
				for purposes of prostitution, or for any other immoral purpose.
				There are also provisions for the exclusion of illiterates, or
				of persons 16 years of age, physically capable of reading, but
				who cannot read English or some other language. All are refused
				admission into U.S.A. The procedure for the enforcement of these
				restrictive and selective measures is mandatory. Detailed
				regulations are laid down for the examination of these
				immigrants before entry, and for their deportation in case of
				exclusion.</p>
			<p>The government goes even further than this, for even after
				entrance the government reserves the right to pursue the policy
				of selection in such cases of criminals or those who have become
				a public charge--even five years after entry--are liable to
				deportation at any time.</p>
			<p>In no other immigration country is the restrictive policy carried
				out so far as in U.S.A. This rigid policy of the U.S. Government
				is the result of its short-sightedness in the past, for while
				this government never openly encouraged immigration, she took up
				a neutral attitude toward the question until 1914. She was much
				like the parents who--not really knowing what shall happen if
				their family continues to grow--nevertheless do nothing to
				prevent it. She now has had to adopt a negative, selective quota
				where she might have in the past adopted a positive, selective
				quota, and this country would today have been in a position to
				deal intelligently with some of the intricate problems that she
				is today unable to face. </p>
