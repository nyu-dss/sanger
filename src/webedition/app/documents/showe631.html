        <h1>Western Women Demand Information</h1>
        <h3 class="italics">By Margaret Sanger</h3>
        <p>After all, it's an ill wind that blows nobody good. California authorities
            are so busy keeping Tom Mooney in jail, fighting
            labor unions, rounding up I.W. W.,
            arresting and deporting Hindus and chasing Bolsheviks, that they don't have time to
            stand guard over advocates of Birth Control. That was the reason, perhaps, why two
            lectures in which information concerning contraceptives was given, were not interfered
            with by these same authorities.</p>
        <p>California women are anxious for practical knowledge of Birth Control. They do not care
            so much for the theory -- what they want to know is how to avoid having children. I have
            visited a number of cities and towns in the state and have found the same feeling
            prevailing everywhere. There is a weariness of indirect methods. There is a lack of
            interest in legislative measures. Only women who are the heads of clubs are still
            hopeful of having the laws changed. The rest simply refuse to think about laws any more.
            They want the information.</p>
        <p>The attitude of a group of workers in San
                Francisco is an accurate indication of the attitude of women generally in
            the state. I was invited to lecture before this body and did so on the night of April
            26th. It had become plain to me that these women had lost faith in legislation, just as
            they had lost faith in courts. They demanded something more than they demanded four
            years ago or two years ago. Then they had been satisfied to know the relation of Birth
            Control to life's social problems. Now they want the relief that Birth Control can bring
            and they don't want anything less.</p>
        <p>It was suggested that I might be arrested for giving information regarding contraceptives
            from the public platform.</p>
        <p>"Go ahead," said the women, "we're <span class="italics">with</span> you--not <span class="italics">behind you</span>."</p>
        <p>That spirit was reflected everywhere.</p>
        <p>In the period allotted for answering question, ten or fifteen women were upon their feet
            at once -- not to discuss generalities, but to ask advice upon their own practical
            problems. Four years, and two years ago, when I lectured in California, hardly a woman
            would rise in public to ask for personal advice about Birth Control.</p>
        <p>The demand for actualities rather than theories exists not only in regard to Birth
            Control but in regard to other matters as well. For example, the decided shift to direct
            action indicates how thoroughly they have put aside their faith in the machinery of law
            making and law enforcement.</p>
        <p>California women know what they want from the Birth Control movement and they are not
            afraid to demand it. They will stand by any person, group or organization in action. And
            they are interested only in action.</p>
