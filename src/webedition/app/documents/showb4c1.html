        <p>Dear Editor; </p>
        <p>Perhaps your readers of this page would be interested in some of the impressions of a
            mother traveling in Europe with three children.</p>
        <p>What glorious visions I had of Glasgow, the City
            where Municipal Ownership has been in operation for some twenty years.</p>
        <p>I have tried since to remember where it was that I had heard it called the Model City,
            but cannot recollect.</p>
        <p>Yet model it is considered as far as administration, is concerned for the men who went
            into office when the Corporation of Glasgow was formed in 1880, are mostly in
            office to day holding down comfortable jobs.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere is cold and damp, it has always just rained, and when the sun does come
            out and show himself it is seldom long enough to dry up the walks.</p>
        <p>In spite of this the streets are fairly clean and tho always damp and wet, it is seldom
            one sees either men or women wearing rubbers. The people seem cold and rigid, as dismal
            as the climate and lacking in human understanding.</p>
        <p>The policemen on the other hand are well acquainted with all sources of information, they
            display no clubs, and seem to be the only persons who have a sense of humor.</p>
        <p>The Corporation of Glasgow has under its jurisdiction the Art Galleries and museums, the
            libraries, parks, tramways, or trolley, the electricity, gas, water, meat, fish and
            vegetable and fruit markets, public bath houses public wash houses, street cleaning, the
            cheese market, bird and dog market, old clothes market cattle market, slaughter houses,
            dead meat market, model lodging houses, the family home, and model tenements, and
            hospitals for small pox and other contagious diseases.</p>
        <p>Certainly all this sounds illuminating, and yet everywhere one looked were you confronted
            with this most appalling sights of poverty and misery.</p>
        <p>Thousands of women walking about with shawls over their heads, or shoulders, which serves
            two purposes that of keeping the woman warm and also helps her to carry the child she
                
        [<em>most</em>]
     invariably carries in her arms. On closer
            inspection you can easily see that her wearing apparel consists of a petticoat, wrapper
            and shoes, with the addition of the shawl already mentioned. Few of this class women
            wear stockings or underwear all the year around. 
       &#8593;anyway at night&#8595;
    </p>
        <p>The expression on their pinched and weary faces is that of slow starvation and nothing
            else.</p>
        <p>These women do not live in the model tenements, nor 
        [<em>buy</em>]
    
            in the meat, fruit or vegetable markets, their families are usually too large for the
            tenements (the laws of Glasgow will not allow overcrowding in the houses) and the
            markets are mostly wholesale products only or are so far away that tho the cost of
            passage is small it's too much and they content themselves with their bread and tea, and
            are thankful for that.</p>
        <p>The bath and wash houses are very popular and tho the cost of the use of a stall is four
            cents (2d) an hour, which includes plenty of hot and cold water, boiling, wringing and
            drying by machine process, They open at 7AM and close at 6PM and until the last hours of
            the day there are women waiting about for empty stalls. It takes about two hours for a
            woman to wash for an average family, which is less than she can 
        [<em>buy</em>]
     the amount of coal it would require for the washing if done at
            home.</p>
        <p>The history of the public wash house dates back to 1878, and were deemed a public
            necessity for the comfort of the male citizens whose comforts were being deprived them
            by washing hanging about in their dismal homes, and on account of the weather and
            seemingly never ceasing rain, that the washing was never dry.</p>
        <p>The men were being driven from their homes says an early report, on this subject, and
            there are today about twenty all told and one of the best paying propositions in the
            City.</p>
        <p>The women carry their clothes to and from their homes, are not allowed on the tramways
            with their baskets so of course it deprives those from its use who can not walking
            distance. Up stairs is the bath house facilities, including, hot baths, swimming Ponds
            (General public), Turkish baths, Gymnasium. For children under 16 years the cost of a
            bath is one penny the use of the gymnasium is an extra penny. Cost for men is 6d, 4d,
            3d. Cost for women 3d. Turkish baths is 1s, Ladies have only one day a week for the use
            of these baths.</p>
        <p>Of Model Lodging houses there are about ten, these are mainly for men only one being used
            for women. They give accommodation for about 2500 persons nightly, and they are mostly
            occupied to their full capacity. Each house is provided with a common dining room a
            kitchen, with utensils and large fire available at all hours of the day, for cooking,
            which of course the individual buys and cooks himself. There are many lockers where food
            can be kept each one having access to his own. There is also in each house a large
            recreation room with benches and tables where the men lounge about. There is also
            lavatory and bathing conveniences, and each person has a separate bunk, with spring
            mattress pillow sheets and blanket, this for the sum of from 3 and a 
        [<em>half</em>]
     d, to 6d per night or from seven to twelve cents a
            night.</p>
        <p>A provision shop is attached to nearly all these houses where food is purchased at the
            regular out side price (not at cost prices) These houses are also considered a financial
            success.</p>
        <p>Then there is a Family home which was constructed for the accommodation of
                "deserving and respectable widows and widowers belonging to the working
                class" having one or more children with no one to care for them while the
            parents were at work.</p>
        <p>This Home has also been turned over for the exclusive use of widowers and their families,
            and as there is only one such establishment in the City the widows and their children
            must struggle and shift for themselves.</p>
        <p>However the idea is a splendid one and to all appearances looks good. The house contains
            160 bedrooms, each capable of accommodating one adult and three children.</p>
        <p>There is a common dining room and kitchen where meals are cooked and served to the
            inmated. Board for children at an average of 1s 7d per week or about forty cents an
            average. The rent of a bedroom is 5s 6d per week or about $1.50. There is a nursery for
            the little ones where nurses care for them during the day, the older children are sent
            to school.</p>
        <p>The whole place is lighted by electricity and heated by hot water, it is managed by a
            superintendent and matron with a staff of nurses and other helpers.</p>
        <p>It is stated that this has resulted in a loss but as it has steadily grown in favor and
            reduces the loss as it increases its residents.</p>
        <p>Besides all this there are owned by the Corporation 
        [<em>over</em>]
    
            1990 one two and three apartment houses.</p>
        <p>The lowest rent charged for the one apartment house is about $30 per year. That for the
            two apartment house about $40 per year. That of the three apartment house about $68 per
            year while the maximum rents are $40, $60, $100, respectively.</p>
        <p>These are all provided with stoves and bunks built in for beds which of course take up
            much less room than the average clumsy movable bed.</p>
        <p>Now all this sounds encouraging does it not yet why is it that there is such bald faced
            misery and poverty in Glasgow?</p>
        <p>Because these things which a municipal ownership administration aims to control are at
            the best only alleviations of their poverty, they have made no attempt to touch at the
            root of all poverty the economic situation, and unless this is done all the alleviation
            in the world will not change the position of the working people. Strange too that where
            the administration aimed at procuring food at a lower cost for the workers, it has today
            gradually lent itself to buying for the small dealer or Capitalist who in turn sells the
            product for the same prices as the larger Capitalist. The wages of the workers are in no
            way affected by the administration for what they are able to obtain from the boss is
            obtained on the job through organization and bitter controversy. The Lords of Capital
            point with pride at the wages of the workers of the shipping industry who they claim
            receive as high as five dollars a day. On investigation I found this to be true when the
            men work all day, but the work is so strenuous that only a few hours a days work can be
            done at a time which brings the average down to fifteen dollars a week.</p>
        <p>The wages of women is very small as is that of men. Every where can be seen little girls
            down on their knees scrubbing the doorsteps and sidewalks in front of the houses, or
            again they are seem carrying huge bundles or baskets of groceries which they deliver at
            the homes of the buyers.</p>
        <p>There is a messengers service where young boys are trained in service and are taught to
            do all kinds of work, imagine my surprise when I phoned to send one of the boys to help
            look after the children for the afternoon, when who should appear for the service but a
            small boy not as large as my own, he was dressed in the English uniform with his tiny
            hat on the side of his head and stood so straight and machine made that it was tempting
            to laugh.</p>
        <p>He remains a half day for fifty cents or by the hour for twelve cents. He takes them out
            for a walk entertainment them and returns them safely at any hour designated
            beforehand.</p>
        <p>I questioned one of the executive officers concerning the poverty of the women, and asked
            why it was that the women looked so much more poverty stricken than the men,. He
            answered that the women of Glasgow were (the lower classes) all most all of drunken
            habits, and were hopeless, dirty, and low. Asked as to the cause of it, he said it was
            their own fault.</p>
        <p>Glasgow certainly leaves a most lasting impression of misery and poverty.</p>
        <p>The tramways have been under the administration since 1894, and today it is stated that
            in two years the money which was borrowed which amounted to 
       &#8593;$13,500,000&#8595;
     will
            be entirely liquidated and with the City's treasury already with a surplus of 
	[<em>one word  missing</em>]
	 There promises to be lively times discussing
            what shall be done with the tramway service, if it will be entirely free, or not. At
            present the fare are one cent a mile for the first mile or 1 half pence but on longer
            rides it averages a little less than a cent a mile.</p>
        <p>The Socialists of Glasgow have led or encouraged the Administration from time to time in
            improving the conditions for the working class, and they are now trying to get the City
            to use its surplus for the building of workmens' homes.</p>
        <p>All together it is impossible to visit the City and not at once recognize that the
            Administration is serving all its efforts in bolstering up the small middleman. Europe
            seem to recognize that the 
        [<em>psychology</em>]
     of the middle
            class is fundamentally its salvation, and makes every effort to keep it alive.</p>
        <p>
            
       &#8593;Working class get no service for tramways huddled about their shipping
                industry&#8595;
