		<h1>MAGNETATION METHODS OF BIRTH CONTROL</h1>
		<h3>By MARGARET H. SANGER</h3>
		
			<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
			<p>In the previous pamphlets, &#8220;English Methods of Birth
					Control&#8221; and &#8220;Dutch Methods of Birth
				Control,&#8221; one finds a duplication of the methods given in the first
				pamphlet, &#8220;Family Limitation.&#8221; The French methods of
				Birth Control are so nearly the same that I have decided not to duplicate these
				again, but to give instead a list of the books and pamphlets issued by the French League, and, also cuts or pictures of
				some of the articles they have for sale at their headquarters, 27 Rue de la Duée,
					Paris. These will be found at the end of this
				pamphlet. </p>
			<p>I also find that the methods used to control births in Germany,
					Italy, Spain, Belgium,
					Norway, Sweden, India,
					Russia, and Japan have all been greatly influenced
				by the English and Dutch Neo-Malthusian League (the two
				oldest Leagues). To give further national methods would be only a waste of time and
				material, and would add nothing to what has already been given. This does not mean
				that there are not many other mechanical devices. There are numerous ones; but I
				still find that there is nothing better, safer, cheaper, or more convenient than the
				pessary mentioned in &#8220;Family Limitation.&#8221; </p>
			<p>In France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Sweden there are strong Neo-Malthusian
				movements advancing the Birth Control theories by lectures, literature, and
				practical means. In Russia, Japan, India, and United States there
				have been recently feeble attempts to establish Birth Control movements; but as yet
				they have remained embryonic.</p>
			<p>I have decided to close this series of pamphlets with the following explanation of
				the Magnetation method, and feel that I have said all that I can say of interest on
				Birth Control methods. I have gladly donated my mite toward what I consider to
				women&#8217;s economic, social, and sexual freedom.</p>
		
		
			<h2>Magnetation Method of Birth Control.</h2>
			<p>Before closing this series of pamphlets on the practical methods of Birth Control, I
				feel in justice to the many readers and subscribers of the Woman Rebel who inquired about the theories of Magnetation, Male
				Continence, Sedular Absorption, Karezza, and Zugassent&#8217;s
					Discovery, that this series would not be complete without giving at
				least a general idea of these theories and their practice.</p>
			<p>It is interesting to note that the magnetation theory had its best and longest
				practice, as well as its beginning, in America, under the title Male Continence.
				This method was practiced for over forty years by a group averaging 130 men and 150
				women known as the Oneida Community. They occupied a part of the old
				reservation of the Oneida Indians in New York State, and lived in a
				harmonious and prosperous form of Communistic society. John Humphrey Noyes was the head and founder
				of the group. Through personal experience and prolonged study, he discovered the
				theory of male continence. Since that time many others have come forward with the
					<span class="italics">same theory</span> under various names. Almost without
				exception, each advocate has injected some kind of religion into it. The Oneida
				Community was particularly a religious sect, and Alice B. Stockham, the author of Karezza,
				was a fervent religionist. However, aside from this, there are fundamental truths in
				the theory which bear thinking about and should not be discarded without some
				consideration. In view of the thousands of testimonials of the healthful results of
				the practice of these theories, I present these methods like that of the others, and
				for convenience shall classify them all under one head, &#8220;Magnetation.&#8221;</p>
			<p>There are thousands of men and women who object to the practical and mechanical means
				of Birth Control, who feel that the pessary, condom, and douche are gross and
				sordid, and take away the artistic and spiritual beauty of the act. It is those whom
				the magnetation method will interest most. There are others who will claim that this
				method is &#8220;not satisfying,&#8221; and can find no enjoyment in its practice. But so are
				there thousands of men and women who can pass a beautiful painting and receive no
				inspiration from it, or listen to a charming selection on a musical instrument and
				receive no emotion from it. So are there many whose natures are not so constructed
				that they can enjoy or benefit by this method. There is no doubt that the successful
				attainment of this method is dependable upon a fine spiritual bond between the two
				who enjoy its practice. </p>
		
		
			<h2>THE THEORY</h2>
			<p>The advocates of the magnetation method ask you to first analyse sexual intercourse.
				They claim that you will recognise in it two distinct acts, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the social (or amative) and the propagative. Those who practice
				the magnetation method content themselves with and prefer the social act, unless the
				procreative act is desired. It is usually held that the sexual organs have <span class="ital">two</span> distinct functions, viz., the urinary and the
				propagative. The advocates of the magnetation theory claim that the sexual organs
				have <span class="italics">three distinct functions</span>, viz., urinary,
				propagative, and amative--<span class="italics">i.e.</span>, they are conductors
				firstly of urine, secondly of semen, and thirdly of social magnetism. Each one
				separate and distinct in itself. </p>
			<p> The organs of propagation are physiologically distinct from the organs of union in
				both sexes. The testicles are the principal organs of reproduction in the male, and
				the uterus in the female. Sexual conjunction of male and female no more involves the
				discharge of semen than of the urine. The discharge of semen, instead of being the
				main act of sexual intercourse, is really the sequel and termination of it. Sexual
				intercourse pure and simple is the conjunction of the organs of union, and the
				interchange and flow of magnetic influences through that conjunction. The seminal
				discharge can be voluntarily withheld in sexual intercourse, or it can be produced
				without sexual intercourse, as in masturbation, which demonstrates the fact that the
				discharge of the semen, and the pleasure associated with its discharge, is not
				social, since it can be produced in solitude: it is a personal and not a social
				act.</p>
			<p>The physiological analysis of the procreative act shows that the pleasure of the act
				is not produced by contact and interchange of life with the female, but by the
				action of the seminal fluid on the internal nerves of the male organ. The desire and
				that which satisfies it are both within the man, and may be obtained without sexual
				intercourse. The amative function, or the simple union of two persons, is a distinct
				and independent function, giving a medium of magnetic interchange superior to that
				gain through reproductive function. it is the presence of the seed abd not the
				absence of it that makes the bull superior to the ox, and it is the stimulating,
				retaining, and absorbing the semen in the man, and directing it into other creative
				channels, which make the amative act of greater benefit and more healthful and
				vitalising than the procreative act. </p>
			<p>Most of us know that creative energy expressed through the sexual nature is an
				instinct to perpetuate life; that it has its origin in and is co-existent with life
				itself; that it is the power back of all purposes and plans; that it is the
				self-pushing force that gives the individual the ability and desire to do and to
				perform; that it is the impelling factor and inventive genius in all man&#8217;s
				handiwork. That this force operates in the multiplication of atoms and molecules, in
				the attraction of germ to sperm cells. The process of growth and fulfilment of
				functions is propelled by this energy, which is operative throughout all Nature. It
				is the force back of and expresses itself through the physical life of man and
				animal.</p>
			<p>Atoms, cells, and plants are unconscious of this force, and animals are conscious of
				it only in a slight degree. But man is conscious of this energy, and is capable of
				developing a greater consciousness of it and of its operation and utilization to a
				remarkable degree. Like the engineer who masters the engine by his knowledge of its
				construction and the force that runs it, so can man master this creative energy and
				direct it where he wills. Creative life can be expressed in other ways beside
				parenthood.</p>
			<p>Emerson says, &#8220;Work your
					passion up into poetry.&#8221; Passion is the sign of creative power; it is the
				voice of creative life. If it were understood and its powers realized, it would be
				elevated and worshipped instead of lowered and debased, as the Comstocks would have
				us do. As creative energy becomes understood and applied, men and women will grow in
				strength of character and in strength of love, and will naturally devote these
				powers to the interests and development of the human race.</p>
		
		
			<h2>THE PRACTICE</h2>
			<p>Each of these theories involves sedular absorption through intercourse without
				culmination. No discharge is allowed, but by a superior control is retained, thereby
				making the act an amative (love) act, and uplifting it from an exhaustive, abrupt
				fertilizing function into a quiet magnetic charm, producing health and increased
				happiness.</p>
			<p>The act of sexual intercourse has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Its beginning or
				first stage is simply the presence of the male organ in the female. The middle or
				second stage is a series of reciprocal motions. The end or third stage is the
				ejaculatory crisis, or the termination of the act. The advocates of male continence,
				Zugassent&#8217;s discovery, sedular absorption, and magnetation claim that the whole
				process up to the third stage is entirely voluntary and can be stopped at any point.
				It is compared to a stream in the three conditions of a fall, a course of rapids
				above the fall, and still water above the rapids. The boatman may decide if he will
				remain in still water or venture down the rapids, or run his boat over the fall.
				They contend that experience will teach him the wisdom of remaining where the rowing
				is easy, unless the object is worthy of going over the falls. Karezza advises to content onself with simple presence in the first
				stage until the magnetic thrill passes off. They are all similar and all aim at the
				same result. I head them under one method - "magnetation.&#8221;</p>
			<p>Those who practice claim the highest possible enjoyment, with no loss of vitality and
				a perfect control of the fecundating power. Its practice greatly involves the art of
				love by a prolonged intercourse preventing that which puts an end to intercourse -
				the ejaculation. The seminal fluid, it is claimed, has an immense immanent value;
				and if kept in the system and magnetized, and reabsorbed by the blood, adds
				enormously to a man&#8217;s mental and magnetic force, which through the ordinary sexual
				act is constantly being expended. That its practice by some men will be difficult
				there can be no doubt; but it can be no more difficult or need a greater power of
				control than that required of the man in the act of &#8220;coitus
					interruptus&#8221; (withdrawal). Those who practice magnetation claim that
				it is far removed from &#8220;repelling asceticism&#8221;; that it gives ample exercise to the
				affections, and opportunity for the exchange of sexual magnetism; but that its
				greatest benefit is that its practice conduces to a higher love development. It is
				the attainment of this control that raises the sexual passion in man and woman to
				its proper place by the side of music and poetry. </p>
			<p>The strongest objection which is put forth against its practice is that it is
				&#8220;unnatural&#8221;; that it is unauthorized by the examples of other creatures of the
				animal kingdom, and therefore must be wrong. But the answer comes that cooking,
				wearing clothes, and all modern life is far removed form natural living; and were we
				to remain in close adherence to Nature, we would go on all fours and remain dumb. </p>
			<p>When we realize we are living in an age when nearly all departments of life have been
				greatly modified and advanced by recent discoveries of steam, electricity, the
				telephone, telegraphy, the microscope, and other agents of enlightenment, is it not
				surprising that there has been almost no discovery or improvement in the vital
				department of the sex relations? The explorer, the pioneer, the discoverer may
				pursue his way into every department of life, and return to lay his riches at the
				feet of Science, Art, or Invention; but woe to him who dares to explore that shaded
				valley of sex. No matter how pure the motive, or what agony and miseries one sought
				to alleviate, dungeons, persecutions, slanders, and jails await him who ventures to
				bring treasures from its hidden depths. Yet there is no other department of life
				which needs so much instruction and education as the sex department.</p>
			<p>A healthful sexual stimulation has a beneficial effect on both men and women,
				especially when the loved one is accessible and some demonstration of sexual feeling
				allowed, as in the restrained yet ardent caresses of an affianced pair. Here we
				often see not only the happiest but the most productive and healthful period of a
				man&#8217;s life. It is said this is particularly true of man&#8217;s intellectual
				activities.</p>
			<p>We see a year later this same happy pair experience a great falling off in their
				affection. Women have experienced this so often that they begin to hate the sexual
				relation, and look upon the act either with fear of pregnancy or with an
				unconquerable loathing. Of course, a great deal of this aversion which women
				experience is the result of their former training. The girl is taught before
				marriage that the act is a most degrading thing, and is told that it is the
				accomplishment of this one thing for which man desires her before marriage.
				Afterwards all is supposed to be changed. She is expected to have an entirely new
				philosophy as soon as the marriage certificate is in her hands. The average young
				man knows little of the art of love, and is consequently unably to beautify their
				relations or to teach her a new psychology. The first year is spent in secret misery
				on her side, and ruptures and misunderstandings between them both. The average woman
				will tell you she loves to be caressed and to express her affection for her husband,
				but could be quite satisfied without intercourse. This is especially true of the
				intellectual woman, who is acknowledging her lessening interest in the sex relation,
				and even repulses affectionate demonstration, fearing it must terminate in sexual
				intercourse (mainly the fear of pregnancy). </p>
			<p>Surely this is something to be squarely faced by every intelligent man and woman, and
				serious enough to deserve our untiring interest. Something must be wrong. What is
				it? Does this theory offer a solution to any? It may. Nearly all women who practice
				it testify to its benefits, while few men complain of it. Those who do, say that to
				control the ejaculation to-day means a seminal loss later during sleep. The
				advocates, however, say this will occur at first, but after the organs become
				accustomed to their new functions this will wear off, and there will be no seminal
				loss. </p>
			<p>All men in the Oneida community realized that this
				control was a necessary attainment if they would be regarded with favor by the women
				in the group. Its accomplishment was necessary to their mutual happiness, and they
				had to learn it. If there is a method which in practice expresses the highest mutual
				affection and reveals one&#8217;s own strength and power, then by all means let mankind
				know it.</p>
			<p>There is no earthly reason why men and women should not study the laws of sex
				expression as any other science is studied, and it should be a study not only
				intellectual, but of experience and adjustment. If, as is claimed, the experience of
				this method must be practiced on a higher plane of thought than the purely physical,
				then certainly it must tend toward a finer companionship and understanding between
				men and women than the fleeting physical gratification prevailing at present. If
				there is anything which controverts the traditional uncleanliness previously
				attached to the sex relation, if there is anything which brings a blending of body
				and spirit or an ennoblement of the character of the individual, then by all means
				let us have it in its fullest detail, and let this revolting ignorance and prudery
				holding sway over men and women&#8217;s minds so long be swept away for all time. Let us
				have light, through discussion, experience, and adjustment. </p>
			<p>There are few men who desire to expose the object of their affection to the burden of
				bearing children faster than her health will permit. They realize a woman&#8217;s strength
				is greatly undermined and her beauty and grace fast ebbing away; but ignorance and
				tradition have him in their grip. He knows nothing about the means to prevent it,
				and allows the one he loves best to wither and fade before his eyes.</p>
			<p>It is especially necessary for the woman to be free from the mental dread of
				pregnancy. There is nothing so productive of nervous disorders or so likely to
				decrease the sexual attraction or magnetation as fear and anxious thought. Perfect
				confidence in the man&#8217;s ability to control himself is essential to the perfection
				and desired results of these methods. Just as one begins, so can one develop. Young
				men and women about to enter alliances and desirous to establish a lasting affection
				and higher bond between themselves can easily put this method into practice and
				control the sex functions. The more magnetic the individual, the greater the sex
				attractions between those two who love, and the stronger the bond will grow between
				them, through this &#8220;magnetation&#8221; method.</p>
			<p>The expression and adjustment of all theories is so largely personal that special
				regulations can scarcely be given. The road to science and the great natural laws
				are discovered through experience: there is no education but that of experience.
