		<h1>America Needs a Code for Babies</h1>
		<h3>A Plea for Equal Distribution of Births by Margaret Sanger</h3>
		<p>It has been officially reported that six million children in the United States are being supported by public relief
			funds. This tragic indictment of our social system indicates, among other things, that
			there has been an overproduction of babies, or, at least, an improper distribution of
			them, so that the couples who have the most babies are the very ones who are least able
			to take care of them.</p>
		<p> While the N.R.A. strives
			through its many codes to increase employment and thus to raise the purchasing power of
			the people in general, it does not provide for lightening the burden of the parents by
			reducing the number of mouths that each wage-earner must feed or which the public must
			feed for him. While the N. R. A. has 
       &#8593;as&#8595;
     its emblem the blue eagle, I am
			afraid that the six million pauperized children have as their emblem a stork that has
			the blues. America needs a baby code!! And I want to make a few suggestions that might
			be considered in the formulation of such a code:</p>
		<p class="blockquote"> Article 1. The purpose of the American Baby Code shall be to provide
			for a better distribution of babies, to assist couples who wish to <span class="underlined">prevent</span> overproduction of offspring and thus to reduce the
			burdens of charity and taxation for public relief, and to protect society against the
			propagation and increase of the unfit.</p>
		<p> The results desired are obviously selective births. By this I mean a selection based on
			the prospects for a successful and happy babyhood, childhood, and eventual citizenship.
			It would be an eminent gain for society if the number of births could vary in direct
			ratio to prospects for adequate care of children.</p>
		<p> The development of latent powers and the mastery over nature are responsible for
			whatever advances man has made away from his primordial states of states of animalism
			and savagery. Out of an initial stage of ignorance as to what caused births, through a
			prolonged stage of superstition regarding these phenomenon, the race has advanced into
			scientific knowledge of how to control births in other ways than by abstinence from
			natural living. But this knowledge is not universal. A fortunate few who have it who
			have it are indifferent about sharing it with others, and there are large groups who
			deliberately and energetically strive to prevent its spread. It is this condition,
			doubtless more than any other factor, which has produced the six million children who
			are public charges.</p>
		<p> More than one million women have written me, some of them tragic, pitiful letters,
			asking for advice on how to prevent unwanted additions to families already too large.
			According to our present Federal laws it is forbidden to convey the desired information
			either through the mails or by common carriers. Some of these women are tuberculosis,
			some have heart trouble, some have no means of support. Others have equally valid
			reasons for wanting to know the technique of prevention, but if a physician were to
			write a letter, even to one of his own patients, giving advice where to go for
			contraceptive instruction, and were to mail that letter, he could be sent to the
			penitentiary for doing so.</p>
		<p> A fight to remove such restrictions is being conducted by the National Committee on
				Federal Legislation for Birth Control, of which I am president. Bills are now
			pending before the Senate and the House of Representatives , which,
			if passed, will permit the use of the mails and common carriers for contraceptive
			information and supplies intended for use by licensed physicians, chartered medical
			colleges, licensed hospitals and clinics, and by druggists in legitimate prescription
			business.</p>
		<p> An extremely important factor in regulating population growth is education. Of no less
			importance is technical assistance. To meet these needs an extension of birth control
			clinics is necessary. At present there are in the United States about 157 birth control
			clinics, some of them restricted as to the help they may give. We need thousands of
			clinics, with greatly enlarged scope of activity. For this reason I suggest the
			following as the next article of the proposed Baby Code:</p>
		<p class="blockquote">Article 2. Birth control clinics shall be permitted to function as
			services of city, county, or state health departments, or under the support of charity,
			or as non-profit self-sustaining agencies, subject to inspection and control by public
			authorities.</p>
		<p> The important function of birth control clinics may in the future include advice for
			those who wish to have children as well as for those seeking a limitation. I do not mean
			to imply that clinical or medical advice can at present be as effective in birth
			promotion as it is in birth control, but nevertheless I feel that the advance of
			physiology, biology, and medicine may add notably to effectiveness in dealing with those
			who are barren and the sterile through functional disorders so that such persons may
			become parents when they want to do so. At any rate, I want to make the point that the
			tragedy of the babies is not so much that the grand total is too large, but that there
			are too many in families that do not want them, cannot take care of them, and should not
			have them.</p>
		<p> If education, technical assistance, and public opinion fail to limit the number of
			babies within certain groups of the population to the country&#8217;s capacity for taking care
			of them, then it may be advisable to adopt more drastic procedure. I hesitate to suggest
			when this might be, because so many of us Americans are afraid of any new forms of
			&#8220;regimentation.&#8221; It will probably always be said that sex relations and parenthood are
			matters too intimate for any interference by public authorities. Of course, there is
			already a considerable amount of interference, or, if you prefer the term, regulation
			through marriage and divorce laws. I wonder if it will also become necessary to
			establish a system of birth permits. At present a marriage license is a birth permit, as
			well a a permit for a man and a woman to maintain a common household. Suppose, for
			purposes of discussion of something that may not prove to be practicable, we add the
			following clauses to the proposed Baby Code:</p>
		<p class="blockquote"> Article 3. A marriage license shall in itself give husband and wife
			only the right to a common household and not the right to parenthood.</p>
		<p class="blockquote"> Article 4. No woman shall have the legal right to bear a child, and no
			man shall have the right to become a father, without a permit for parenthood.</p>
		<p class="blockquote"> Article 5. Permits for parenthood shall be issued upon application by
			city, county, or state authorities to married couples, providing they are financially
			able to support the expected child, have the qualifications needed for proper rearing of
			the child, have no transmissible diseases, and, on the woman&#8217;s part, no medical
			indication that maternity is likely to result in death or permanent injury to
			health.</p>
		<p class="blockquote"> Article 6. No permit for parenthood shall be valid for more than one
			birth.</p>
		<p> All that sounds highly revolutionary, and it might be impossible to put the scheme into
			practice. But for purposes of discussion let the clauses stand. Suppose that we had such
			regulations, and suppose that couples went ahead and had children without permits and
			regardless of the law. Well, we should be no worse off in the matter of births than we
			are now. Certainly the regulations would not increase the production of children in the
			wrong families; the tendency would be the other way. However, a general respect for the
			law regarding birth permits might be fostered by punishing transgressors. Society could
			not very well put a couple into jail for having a baby without permission; and in the
			case of paupers a fine could not be collected. How then should the guilty be punished?
			By blacklisting? By depravation of certain civil rights, such as the right to vote? If
			punishment is not practicable, perhaps we can go the other way around and consider
			awards. If it is wise to pay farmers for not raising cotton or wheat, it may be equally
			wise to pay certain couples for not having children.</p>
		<p> Considering this question leads us inevitably to the question of quotas. What is social
			planning without a quota? But a little thinking soon reveals the difficulty of
			establishing any numerical quota for births. It does not seem feasible to fix a given
			number of births as desirable for a county, or any other political division, during a
			particular year. Variations of birth rate within social classes might not affect the
			total number and yet might in one county improve the situation and in another make it
			worse. But perhaps something might be done by seeking a definite ratio between the birth
			rate and an index of child welfare, this index to be the opposite of what we may call
			child illfare. I suggest the following clause:</p>
		<p class="blockquote">Article 7. Every country shall be assisted administratively by the
			state in the effort to maintain a direct ratio between the county birth rate and its
			index of child welfare. Whenever the county records for any given year show an
			unfavorable variation from this ratio the county concerned shall be taxed by the state
			according to the degree of the variation. The revenues thus obtained shall be expended
			by the state within the given county either in giving financial support to birth control
			clinics or in other ways calculated to improve the situation involved.</p>
		<p>Assuming that the social workers and statisticians would not have serious difficulty in
			devising and keeping up an index of child welfare, the proposed scheme would, I think,
			be effective. The main result would be the creation of a strong community sentiment in
			favor of helping those couples who wish to prevent conception because they foresee that
			the children if born would be doomed to suffering. For the couples who are not willing
			to cooperate moral pressure would be brought to bear.</p>
		<p> Finally we have the problem of how to stop reproduction by those who are recognised as
			biologically unfit, or who have inheritable diseases. According to the report of experts
			made at the famous White House Conference on Child Health and Protection,
			there were in 1930 more than 10,000,000 handicapped children in the United States. This
			total included those improperly nourished, the tuberculous, those with weak or damaged
			hearts, the crippled, blind, and deaf, those with defective speech, and the mentally
			retarded, delinquent, and dependent. A large proportion of these were doomed before they
			were born. Now that they are here we must take care of them, at enormous cost. Billions
			of dollars must be raised ever year by taxation or charitable contribution to pay for
			the treatment and care of individuals who have been handicapped for birth.</p>
		<p> Many groups of the socially unfit, as for example the feeble-minded and the criminal,
			are not sufficiently susceptible to education or the moral pressure of the community.
			For such people sterilization is indicated. Some states already have sterilization laws,
			and others should adopt similar measures. While there must be ample safeguards in
			administering such laws so that the rights of the individual are considered, the
			paramount need is to protect society as a whole. Sterilization would go far in reducing
			human misery, not to speak of the financial saving in the upkeep of the unfit offspring.
			Therefore I suggest the following clause in the Baby Code:</p>
		<p class="blockquote">Article 8. Feeble-minded persons, habitual congenital criminals, those
			afflicted with inheritable disease, and others found biologically unfit by authorities
			qualified judge should be sterilized or, in cases of doubt, should be so isolated as to
			prevent the perpetuation of their afflictions by breeding.</p>
		<p> I do not pretend in the above suggestions to have arrived at the formulation of a
			workable baby code, but my puzzling over this problem has convinced me that America
			needs such a code. I should be very much interested in hearing the suggestions of
			others.</p>
		<p> This is the great day of social planning. We have come to believe in planning the
			production and distribution of goods. We plan methods of governing cities, states, and
			the nation. We plan jobs, and leisure-time activities, and vacations. We plan almost
			everything, big and little, except families. It can scarcely do any harm and it may do a
			vast amount of good to engage in thoughtful, planning of our population, a population
			with a still larger percentage of happy families. </p>
