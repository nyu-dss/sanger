        <h1>First Speech</h1>
        <h3>MARGARET SANGER</h3>
        <p>Mr. Chairman, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Russell and I seem to agree on
            some of the points of this argument at least, but as usual with most of the opponents of
            birth control, they have absolutely no intelligent argument. (Laughter.) They always
            barricade themselves behind the Bible or the terrible vengeance of an
            offended nature. That is exactly what Mr. Russell is doing now.</p>
        <p>Now, friends, I want to say let us get down to fundamental principles. Let us get
            together and look at life the way it is now, not as it might have been had Nature acted
            thus and so, not as it might be had God done thus and so, but as we find ourselves
            today. We have a few principles of life by which we must live, and I claim that everyone
            of us has a right to health, to liberty and to the pursuit of happiness. I say
            furthermore that birth control is an absolutely essential factor in our living and
            having those three principles of happiness. (Applause.)</p>
        <p>By birth control, I mean a voluntary, conscious control of the birth rate by means that
            prevent conception--scientific means that prevent conception. I don't mean birth control
            by abstinence or by continence or anything except the thing that agrees with most of us,
            and as we will develop later on, most of us are glad that there are means of science at
            the present time that are not injurious, not harmful, and all conception can be
            avoided.</p>
        <p>Now, let us look upon life as it really is, and we see society today is divided
            distinctly into two groups: those who use the means of birth control and those who do
            not.</p>
        <p>On the one side we find those who do use means in controlling birth. What have they? They
            are the people who bring to birth few children. They are the people who have all the
            happiness, who have wealth and the leisure for culture and for mental and spiritual
            development. They are the people who rear their children to manhood and womanhood and
            who fill the universities and the colleges with their progeny. Nature has seemed to be
            very kind to that group of people. (Laughter.)</p>
        <p>On the other hand we have the group who have large families and who have for generations
            perpetuated large families, and I know from my work among these people that the great
            percentage of these people that are brought into the world in poverty and misery have
            been unwanted. I know that most of these people are just as desirous to have means to
            control birth as the women of wealth. I know she tries desperately to obtain that
            information, not for selfish purposes, but for her own benefit and for that of her
            children. In this group, what do we have? We have poverty, misery, disease,
            overcrowding, congestion, child labor, infant mortality, maternal mortality, all the
            evils which today are grouped in the crowd where there are large families of unwanted
            and undesired children.</p>
        <p>Take the first one and let us see how these mothers feel. I claim that a woman, whether
            she is rich or poor, has a right to be a mother or not when she feels herself fit to be
            so. She has just as much right not to be a mother as she has to be a mother. It is just
            as right and as moral for people to talk of small families and to demand them as to want
            large families. It is just as moral.</p>
        <p>If we let, as we are supposed to do, Nature take her course, we will say that we know
            that any woman from the age of puberty until the age of the period of the menopause,
            that that woman could have anywhere from 15 to 20 children in her lifetime, and it will
            only take one relationship between a man and a woman to give her one a year to give her
            that large family. Let us not forget that.</p>
        <p>Are we today, as women who wish to develop, who wish to advance in life, are we willing
            to spend all of our time through those years of development in bringing forth children
            that the world does not appreciate? Certainly, anyone who looks out to that will find
            that there is very little place in the world for children. And besides, if a woman does
            spend all her time in child bearing, do you know that even with a healthy woman, that if
            she does this, one out of ten of these women who have children as often as Nature sends
            them, dies from child bearing? One out of every ten of women who let Nature take her
            course and have from 12 to 16 children die from child bearing, and furthermore, there
            are many cases where it is absolutely indispensable for a woman's health, for her life
            in fact, to have means to control birth. There are cases, as Dr. Knopf said of syphilis,
            cases of tuberculosis; do you realize that out of every seven women who have
            tuberculosis today that four of them die, not from tuberculosis, my friends, but they
            die from pregnancy. They die because they have not that knowledge of birth control,
            because our physicians and all the others who should be disseminating information and
            safeguarding these women's lives are not giving them the fundamental things to cure her
            disease, but they allow her to become pregnant. They keep her in ignorance from this
            particular knowledge that should assist her in recovering her health. Not only with
            tuberculosis, but there are other diseases that are inimicable to the woman's health and
            happiness. Heart disease is another thing that pregnancy absolutely stimulates and it
            means a woman's death. Not long ago there was a young girl who came to me who had kidney
            disease. She was a telegraph operator. Her husband was a young working man, but he was
            not able to support a family. She had on two different occasions tried to have children,
            but she had kidney disease and they found her in convulsions, she had froth at her mouth
            and she was taken to the hospital in a serious and critical condition. When she did
            this, the only thing they could do to her was to resort to abortion and yet they send
            her back to her home, to her husband and family again in just the same way with no
            information of how to protect herself against another condition just as she had gone
            through. That is what happens to our women today, even those who are suffering from
            diseases where they should be protected with means and knowledge of birth control.</p>
        <p>The only weapon that women have and the most uncivilized weapon that they have to use if
            they will not submit to having children every year or every year and a half, the weapon
            they use is abortion. We know how detrimental abortion is to the physical side as well
            as to the psychic side of the woman's life, and yet there are in this nation, because of
            these generalities and opinions that are here before us, that are stopping the tide of
            progress, we have more than one million women with abortions performed on them each
            year.</p>
        <p>What does this mean? It means it is a very bad sign if women have to indulge in it, and
            it means they are absolutely determined that they cannot continue bringing children into
            the world that they cannot clothe, feed, and shelter. It is woman's instinct, and she
            knows herself when she should and should not give birth to children, and it is just as
            natural to trust that instinct and to let her be the one to say and much more natural
            than it is to leave it to some unknown God for her to judge her by. I claim it is a
            woman's duty and right to have for herself the right to say when she shall and shall not
            have children.</p>
        <p>We know that the death rate, maternal death rate, has not been falling in theUnited States of America, although the death rate from
            other diseases has been falling. That shows that women is given the last consideration
            in scientific and medical lines. But then women will never get her own freedom until she
            fights for it, and she has to fight hard to hold and keep it. We know too that when the
            children that come to this mother against her will and against her desires, when they
            come into the world, that we have an appalling number of 300,000 babies each year in
            this country who die each year before they reach one year of age--300,000 if you please,
            and it is safe to say and anyone who has gone among these mothers of these children --
            it is safe to say that the great percentage of these children that are born have been
            unwanted. The mother knows that that child should not come to birth, when the five or
            six or seven that she has have not enough to eat. That takes common sense and every
            working woman has that common sense.</p>
        <p>We have these 300,000 babies, this procession of little coffins, and we shake our heads
            sadly and say "something must be done to reduce this number," but
            nevertheless we go right on allowing 600,000 parents to remain in ignorance of how to
            prevent 300,000 more babies coming to birth the next year, only to die from poverty and
            sickness.</p>
        <p>We speak of the rights of the unborn. I say that it is time to speak of those who are
            already born. I also say and know that the infant death rate is effected tremendously by
            those who arrive first, and those who arrive last. The first child that comes--the first
            or second or third children who arrive in a family, have a far better chance than those
            who arrive later.</p>
        <p>We know that out of a thousand children born that 200 of them live when they are either
            the second or third. When the seventh arrives there are 300 that die out of that
            thousand, and by the time that the twelfth child arrives, 600 of this thousand passed
            away, and so we can see that the man or woman who brings to birth two or three children
            has a far better chance of bringing them to maturity than if they continued to have nine
            or ten or twelve children.</p>
        <p>Those are facts. They are not generalities or opinions. The United States
                Government stands behind these facts. Then we also, through our maternity
            centers and child welfare means and other means, we finally rescue some of these
            children, and do not allow them to die under one year of age, and then when the mother
            is pregnant again--if maternity was not forced upon her--she would be able to bring that
            child through. Another one begins to come, and we find that this child that was rescued
            from dying during its first year now succumbs before its fifth year, and then we have
            150,000 children who die before they reach the fifth year of age, and so we can
            enumerate all of these conditions which are so despicable and so difficult in this
            country because we will not get to fundamentals. We will not deal with the cause of
            things while we are anxious to deal with the cure. When a mother does finally bring her
            children through the adolescent period, what is the next thing she has for that? We find
            in the South that where children come according to Nature, every year and one-half, that
            as soon as they are able, they are shuffled and hustled on in to take the place and
            compete with their father in the factories. That is the place that society has for the
            children of the poor. We find in other States, too where it is only a question of a few
            years later that also the children, as soon as they are able to take their place in
            industry, are pushed out of the home, not because the mothers of these children are not
            just as anxious to see them in the universities and colleges, but because of the
            pitiless earnings that she must have to support those who are coming behind them.</p>
        <p>Most of us know this. We know something about the actual conditions of life as it is
            among us. In some of the factories of Lowell and Fall River, Mass., it was found that of the children
            who work and toil there, under ten years of age, that 85% of them come from families of
            eight--their mothers have given birth to eight children--and we find in the South very
            much the same thing, excepting a higher percentage of 90 to 93% of the children
            there.</p>
        <p>That is not the only thing. We have a condition not only as these that I have related,
            but we have conditions again that is more disastrous to the race than child labor or
            infant mortality, and that is the transmission of venereal disease to the race that is
            to come.</p>
        <p>We know that the mothers and fathers of today produce the race of tomorrow, and we know
            that unless we have a clean child and a clean stream of blood pouring through that
            child, that the race of tomorrow is a doomed, foregone conclusion. We know, too, that
            out of this terrible scurge of venereal disease that we have 90% of the insanity in this
            country, due to syphilis. Anyone who is dealing with fundamentals would know that these
            people should use means to protect themselves against having children. They should
            absolutely in due regard to themselves, to their children and to the race, not allow a
            child to be born while that disease is running riot in the system, and then we have that
            terrible consequence which is insanity.</p>
        <p>We have 50% of the still births of this country, in other words, dead babies, that are
            dead when they are born--50% are due to this disease. You may think that these things
            are taken care of, but if I told you that they are not--syphiletic women today are
            allowed to bring forth progeny even in the face of all officialdom, and all the kind and
            humane things and other kind of things that are doled out to women today--that women are
            bringing forth children when they themselves are syphiletic.</p>
        <p>Not long ago we took a syphiletic woman to 43 hospitals in the city and everyone of them
            said, "We will cure her disease. Leave her here. We will do the best we can
                for her, but don't ask us to give her the information to control birth. That is not
                our office. That is not for us," and so that little syphiletic woman went
            back again to her home and will become pregnant only to abort again, which was a great
            kindness.</p>
        <p>Nature sometimes brings the syphiletic to birth before their full time, or brings them to
            birth dead. In other states of syphilis, that is not so, and we have feeble-minded as
            well as insane. We have here 400,000 feeble-minded people in the United States, that any
            authority on this subject would say to you, "Not one of them should have been
                born." They never should have been born and sometimes these parents are
            perfectly normal, and yet this taint has gone through the blood and has left this
            perfectly, normal, physical person, who arrives at the adult age with all its physical
            functions, and yet it has the mentality of a child eight years of age. The feeble-minded
            man or woman is of no use to itself or society, and it would be better if we were living
            in a real civilization that they should not have been born. Only 40,000 of this 400,000
            are entered in institutions, and the others are living among us, producing and
            reproducing their progeny and providing abundant material and opportunity for the
            continuance of charities and other institutions for ages and generations more to
            come.</p>
        <p>We found also in one institution--a so-called reformatory where they take the girls of
            the underworld--prostitutes--in Geneva, Ill., they find
            that 50% of these girls coming into the underworld--the prostitutes--was of this cause,
            that she belonged to the feeble-minded, and again we find that 89% of these came from
            large families. . . .</p>
        <p>You can't get away from it, my friend. Large families and poverty and misery go hand in
            hand. Now, what do we try to do for all these conditions? How do we look out upon them?
            We are in a track. Motherhood has been tracked. We find that most of the social agencies
            of the country are trying to legislate these things out of existence. That is all. They
            run off to Albany and to Washington and they make eight-hour laws for women in industry, but they
            never think of the poor mother in the homes who might have eight hours. Can you think of
            the mother in the home with eight hours? She has to go out of the home, out into
            industry to be protected by that law. Do you realize that mothers and women never have a
            night's rest from the time that they are pregnant, some of them until the doors of
            nature closes their maternal functions? They never know what it is to have one whole
            night's rest. They are up nights with babies. Is this freedom or liberty? Hasn't she a
            right to herself--hasn't she a duty to herself to say when and under what conditions she
            shall be a mother?</p>
        <p>We try to reduce our infant mortality rate by our milk stations and all of the other
            things going on today. Thousands and thousands of dollars are spent for this condition,
            and to a certain degree some of it is taken care of, but it does not get at the root.
            When we came to the maternal mortality we find also huge funds that are spent on nurses
            going into the homes of the poor, telling the mother of the eight children how to have
            her ninth. (Laughter.) Most of us know that that mother wants to know how not to have
            her tenth. That is the welcome assistance that they can give that woman, but that will
            be the last stone to be turned.</p>
        <p>Also our child labor--we make laws in Washington against child labor, hoping we will wipe
            that out of existence. For fifty years they have been trying to wipe child labor off the
            books in the United States, but they have not succeeded and they will never succeed
            until they establish birth control clinics in those districts where these women are,
            where they put in birth control clinics, like they have in Holland--in
            every industrial section in the United States where women can come to trained nurses and
            physicians and get from them scientific information whereby they may control birth.</p>
        <p>Now we look upon all these things just about in the same way. We try to palliate most all
            of them. Take one instance--our immigration laws. The United States Government makes the
            most rigid laws. It scans over the vessels carefully to see that no one should enter who
            is an idiot, who is insane, and who is a pauper. They see to it that anyone who enters
            is not an idiot, is not insane, and is not a pauper. They make those rigid laws and
            rules for those who shall come in, but after you are once on the inside, you can produce
            and reproduce and repopulate the earth with syphiletic and diseased and insane people as
            far as the government is concerned. This is the short-sighted side of our whole life. We
            are very generous and sympathetic, but we are oversentimental, and the time has come to
            use our minds and to apply our intelligence to life and to the conditions of life as we
            find them today.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Russell has said some things that are very interesting to me. He tells us that
            we cannot have pleasure without pain. It is a man who is speaking. (Laughter and
            applause.) It is very peculiar that Nature only works on the one side of the human
            family when it comes to that law. She applies all the pain to the woman. It is absurd--a
            perfectly absurd argument in the face of rational intelligence (applause) to talk about
            marriage being for one purpose.</p>
        <p>Now I claim--and I differ with Mr. Russell on that--I claim that the sex relationship has
            distinctly two functions. It has its love function and it has its maternal and paternal
            function. One is quite independent of the other, and one is just as moral as the other,
            and if it were not so, then the laws of this country ought to divorce the woman who is
            not able to have children. Absolutely! And we know it does not. We know that the time
            the children are created that there is not 1% of humanity that is born or created with
            that thought in mind. Very few people think at the time of creation that they are going
            to create. Most of us are brought into the world by accident and that is exactly what
            birth control is going to change. That is going to make humanity a conscious and
            voluntary thing.</p>
        <p>When we talk of race suicide, it would take almost a whole afternoon to tell you how
            futile that argument is. We know perfectly well, those of us who have studied the
            question that in those countries where birth control knowledge has been at the disposal
            of the people that, although the birth rate has gone down, that the death rate has also
            gone down. Consequently the population has been accelerated and there has been a better
            population because it has been a better and healthier population. If Mr. Russell wants
            to talk about the race and does not want race suicide, he better come over quickly to
            the ranks of birth control. (Applause.)</p>
