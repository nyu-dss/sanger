        <h1>The Birth-Control Raid</h1>
        <p>"This is my party!" shouted Policewoman Mary Sullivan, in the midst of her personally conducted raid on the
                Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau in New
                York City, last week. Subsequent developments have demonstrated that this
            boast was as premature as it was untruthful. For Policewoman Sullivan's little raiding
            party, carried out with a vigor that swept aside as unnecessary such things as common
            courtesy and ordinary good manners, has proved to be of vital interest to every thinking
            member of this community. And the end is not yet in sight. As I write these indignant
            words, the announcement comes that Chief Magistrate William McAdoo now admits that the police, in seizing the case histories
            of our patients, had exceeded the scope of the search warrant he had issued authorizing
            this raid--an act on their part which constitutes a misdemeanor. </p>
        <p>After you have spent some fifteen years, slowly and with infinite pains and patience
            working for the right to test the value of contraceptive practice in a scientific and
            hygienic--and lawful--manner, without interfering with the habits or the morals of those
            who disagree with you, it is indeed difficult to submit with equanimity to such brutal
            indignities as were gratuitously thrust upon us at the clinic a week ago. Compensations
            there have been, of course--mainly in the enlightened attitude of such dailies as the
                New York Herald Tribune and others, and the generous offers of aid from
            distinguished physicians. But even these can scarcely counterbalance the evidence of the
            sinister and secret power of our enemies.</p>
        <p>As in the breaking up of the birth-control meeting in the Town Hall, in 1921,
            the raid on the Birth Control Research Bureau gives us a glimpse of the animus which may
            direct the action of the police. In their futile efforts to annihilate a social agency
            which had already been given a clean bill of health by the health department of the
            municipality, by the state board of charities and by the Academy of Medicine, our hypocritical
            antagonists have not the courage to fight us squarely, in the open, but adopt the
            cowardly subterfuge of utilizing minor and crassly ignorant members of the police force.
            Our research bureau has been functioning since 1923, operating within the law, and
            cooperating with recognized charitable institutions.</p>
        <p>From whatever point of view it is analyzed, Policewoman Sullivan's "party" was a deplorable failure. A failure, first of all, because it has
            exposed a complete lack of intelligence in those who conducted it, and a woeful lack of
            coordination in the police department itself. It is not enough for Grover Whalen or District Attorney Banton to disclaim all foreknowledge of the raid.
            Modest as may be the headquarters of the research bureau, it is highly significant and
            important. Therefore, to permit minor members of the police force, or hostile assistants
            in the office of the District Attorney, to pass judgement upon its fate, denotes either
            a lack of coordination of powers, or a bland carelessness in directing them. Certainly
            no official of the city government, cognizant of awakened public opinion concerning the
            social value of contraception, and aware, moreover, of the searching criticism to which
            the police department of New York City is now subjected, would ever have chosen the
            present moment as one psychologically suited to inaugurate a brutal raid upon a modest
            unadvertised clinic which was functioning quietly and successfully in an obscure side
            street, minding its own business and hoping that its powerful ecclesiastical neighbors
            would mind theirs. At a time when the criminal elements of the city--racketeers,
            gangsters, gunman and hijackers--are so active and successful, it would seem to a
            bystander that all the intelligence, skill, and brawn of the force should be mobilized
            and focused upon "crime control."</p>
        <p>Even the thrill of satisfaction we have had in the offers of distinguished doctors to
            testify in our behalf, in the letters to the press, and the courageous outspoken
            editorials, cannot obliterate the memory of Policewoman Sullivan standing in the clinic
            and shouting vigorously and victoriously "This is my party!" I would
            rather forget that here was a woman fighting against other women who were devoting their
            lives to succor and to save their fellow women. By trickery and hypocrisy she had
            obtained her "evidence," and now she triumphantly commanded the doctors and nurses into
            the waiting patrol wagons.</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome of this raiding party, I hereby call upon the citizens of New York
            to find out for themselves how and where it originated, and why it was carried out. I
            ask them to recall the breaking up by the police of the birth-control meeting in Town
            Hall, with the subsequent revelation that this illegal action was instigated by Roman
            Catholic ecclesiastical authorities. We are paying, and paying heavily, for the support
            of a great police force. It is our right and duty to insist that it shall function in an
            efficient, legal, and socially effective manner. Policewoman Sullivan's "party" exposes it as operating in a manner which suggests the gratification of
            private prejudices and unreasoning emotion, rather than the even-handed administration
            of justice and the law.</p>
