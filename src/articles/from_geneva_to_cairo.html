<h1>"From Geneva to Cairo: Margaret Sanger and the First World Population Conference"</h1>

<p>     The third UN-sponsored International Conference on
Population and Development held this fall in Cairo was
marked by, among other things, unusually strong advocacy not
only of women's right to make their own reproductive
decisions, but their need for greater access to education and
health care.  As Dr. Nafis Sadik, Secretary General of the
Conference, stated in her 1994 report on the state of the world
population, "only by improving the status of women through
education and health care can we effectively slow population
growth" (<em>New York Times</em>, 8/19/94).  Women's voices have
not always been heard so clearly at world population
conferences despite the fact that the first such world
conference was organized by Margaret Sanger.</p>

<p>    Sanger had argued for the right and the need to provide
women with the means to determine whether and when they
will have children.  But by the 1920s she had concluded that to
reach that goal, her message of empowerment and autonomy
for women would have to be subsumed into less overtly
feminist, more seemingly abstract scientific rationales.  Sanger
was willing to employ eugenicist and neo-Malthusian
justifications for birth control because she believed that aside
from the benefit it would provide to women, birth control
would build stronger generations of children and would help
insure the physical, economic, and political health of a society. </p>


<p>Sanger had participated in the 5th International Neo-Malthusian conference in London in 1922 and organized the
6th Conference in 1925, the first such conference held in the
U.S., but to win global acceptance for birth control her
message would have to be even more conservatively clothed. 
Sanger recognized that she would have to win the support of
the broader world scientific community, not just those
scientists already interested in population control.  To do this
Sanger sought an international forum that would give
prominence and respectability to discussions of the impact of
population-related issues.  With funds donated by her husband
J. Noah Slee and other supporters, as well as a grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation, Sanger spent close to a year
organizing a World Population Conference to be held in
Geneva, Switzerland on August 31-September 2, 1927.  </p>

<p>    The conference was composed of six sessions dealing with
various aspects of the population question.  Each session was
set up to include, as Sanger pointed out, "scientific essays by
recommended authorities to be followed by critical discussion" (<em>Proceedings of the World Population Conference,</em> London,
1927, p. 5). The conference featured such papers as Raymond
Pearl's "Biology of Population Growth," F.A.E. Crew's
"Concerning Fertility and Sterility in Relation to Population"
and Edward M. East's "Food and Population."</p>

<p>   In providing a global arena for discussion of population
growth and its impact, the conference was an unparalleled
success.  Attendees included everyone from Julian Huxley to
John Maynard Keynes.  However, Sanger's real goal was to
push the "population aspects of birth control" and the delegates
were not yet ready to reach consensus on the population
question. (Margaret Sanger: <em>  An Autobiography</em>, New York,
1938, p. 385).  As Sanger noted "The papers of Professors
East and Fairchild came perilously near mentioning the
forbidden word Malthusianism, but as for birth control, it was
edged about like a bomb which might explode at any minute" (<em>Autobiography</em>, p. 387).</p>
<p>     Moreover while she had accepted that women's concerns
and a feminist agenda would have to be muted in order to gain
broad-based support abroad, Sanger did not realize that this
might require that she would be forced to efface herself from
the proceedings.  Despite almost single-handedly putting the
conference together, Sanger was asked by  Sir Bernard Mallet,
president of Britain's Royal Statistical Society and conference
chairman, to remove her name and those of her (female)
assistants from the official program on the grounds that  "the
names of the workers should not be included on scientific
programs." (<em>Autobiography</em>, p. 385)  Despite Sanger's
insistence that all of the women involved were as much
participants as the scientists on the program, and even a protest
strike by the clerical staff, Sanger realized the intensity of the
opposition she faced.  To salvage the conference, she
convinced her assistants to
accept the situation and
allowed the program to be
printed without mention of
the women's names
(including her own).  </p>

<p>     Sanger recalled that
their exclusion was glossed
over by the conference
participants.  "Only our
young English friends had
held out for the recognition
of the women," she
recalled, "I was not
surprised at the Europeans,
but it was difficult to
comprehend the American
attitude on this point" (<em>Autobiography</em>, p. 386). 
Even more difficult to
accept was the fact that
during the conference itself
Sanger's name was not
even mentioned until the
closing dinner when
Chairman Mallet patronizingly offered:</p>

<p>
"I cannot sit down without an expression, perhaps too
long delayed, of admiration for Mrs. Sanger... she
gave me certain  assurances which made the
cooperation of myself and some of my friends
possible; and she has devoted herself with
wholeheartedness to further the interests of the
Conference, that the great fundamental question of
population should be discussed in a purely scientific
spirit." (<em>Proceedings of the World Population Conference</em>, 1927, p. 356.)
</p>


<p>    Sanger later tried to be fatalistic about the way she had been
treated, noting that it was not she but her husband, J. Noah Slee, who was disturbed by the conference events because "he
had not realized that [birth control] was not to be to the front
in it at all."  However, Sanger did admit that she felt that
"some of those upon whom I had relied to stand by in the time
of war &ndash; failed and compromised &ndash; and so it goes" (Sanger to
Hugh de Selincourt, Sept. 22, 1927, courtesy of Lawrence Lader).  Nevertheless, Sanger realized that the conference was
a momentous event and agreed to take on the painstaking task
of editing the proceedings, which were published in 1927 by
Edward Arnold & Co.  The volume contains both excerpts of
the papers and transcripts of the discussions that followed. 
With her name appearing as editor on the title page, Sanger
finally got some of the recognition she had earned.</p>

<p>   Despite the personal humiliation to Sanger, the Geneva
Conference can be counted as a success if only because it was
the first time scientists were willing to discuss the population
problem on a global scale.  Unfortunately, it would take 27
years before another World Population Conference was even
held (in Rome in 1954 under U.N. auspices).  And it was still
another 40 years after that before women's issues and concerns
were given a full hearing.  While Margaret Sanger did not
succeed in bringing women's rights to the front of the world's
stage in 1927, her lifelong efforts contributed to the fact that
these issues were at long last addressed in Cairo in 1994.  The
Cairo conference was repeatedly described in the press as the
first such conference organized by women.  Not surprisingly
no one mentioned Margaret Sanger.</p>
