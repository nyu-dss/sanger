		<h1>THE PROS AND CONS OF BIRTH CONTROL</h1>
		<h3>By MARGARET SANGER</h3>
		<p> How many people know that nearly sixty years ago Congress passed a law which made it a Penitentiary offence for anyone (even a
			doctor) to send through the United States Mails the address of another
			physician, or a clinic <span class="underline">where</span> one could obtain information
			to prevent conception?</p>
		<p>At that time, it is true, <span class="del">that</span> very little was known about the controversial
			subject, now known as Birth Control. The instigator of that law, Anthony Comstock, was a religious bigot, ignorant
			as he was fanatical.<span class="del"> His idea was</span>
			
       &#8593;He seemed imbued with the complex&#8595;
     that everything relating to sex was
			obscene. He <span class="del">made</span>
			
       &#8593;allowed&#8595;
     no exceptions to scientific or medical needs or facts. All was
			classed in his mind as obscene. Though over two generations have passed since the time
			that law was enacted, women have gained suffrage; colleges and universities teach
			scientific biological facts of life to students; social hygiene is part of our
			educational programme; yet nothing has been done by women&#8217;s clubs, colleges or the
			medical profession to dignify their stand by cleaning up these archaic laws.</p>
		<p>Some of us in the Birth Control Movement have attempted to amend these Federal Laws and
			are now working in Washington, D.C.</p>
		<p>The first obstacle in the removal of any bad law is 
       &#8593;to attack&#8595;
     the ignorance
				<span class="del">regarding its effect</span>
			
       &#8593;surrounding it&#8595;
    . While Congressmen&#8217;s families are notoriously small, as are
			doctors and ministers, and the professional and artisan classes, they seem unable to
			concede that Birth Control knowledge should be given 
       &#8593;to others especially&#8595;
     to
			the poor people who 
       &#8593;need and&#8595;
     want it 
       &#8593;most&#8595;
    .</p>
		<p>The essential facts of birth control are, First, that it is prevention of conception, not
			interruption of a pregnancy after conception has taken place. Second, that it is <span class="underline">control</span>, not 
       &#8593;necessarily&#8595;
     limitation; to control
			the birth rate is to control the size of the family; it means the spacing of births in
			the family with some regard to the mother&#8217;s health; to the inheritance both husband and
			wife are able or likely to pass on to children; to the health of the children already
			born; to the father&#8217;s earning power; to the standards of living the parents wish to
			maintain.</p>
		<p>These considerations should be regarded in planning marriage, <span class="del">and</span>
			
       &#8593;for&#8595;
     it is a well-known fact that couples who can space the arrival of babies,
			from three to four years, are 
       &#8593;better&#8595;
     able to care for a good sized family of
			four children on the average wage of a skilled worker.</p>
		<p>No wage earner can possibly care for <span class="underline">all</span> the children
			nature can bestow upon a healthy normal couple. On an average there are thirty years of
			possible fertility in a woman&#8217;s life during which time should could produce twenty to
			twenty-five children. Not all of them would live, of course, but funerals and doctors
			bills are heavy burdens on a working man&#8217;s already meager income.</p>
		<p>The history of labor has been an age long battle to bring man&#8217;s earning power up to his
			needs for a growing and increasing family. It&#8217;s been a losing battle all the way for by
			increasing his numbers he has brought about hunger and want, ignorance and strife; He
			goes on strike to increase his wage, while a mob of hungry workers stand ready and
			willing to take his place at the factory gates. It is the man with a large family who is
			tied down by fear of losing his job. He is the last to fight for higher wages when a
			strike comes, and the first to crawl back at any price. The plain truth of the labor
			problem is that the workers have produced too many children--too many for their own
			good; too many for the health of the mother, too many for the health, development and
			happiness of their own children and too many for <span class="del">their own class.</span>
			
       &#8593;our civilization in its present state of evolution.&#8595;
    </p>
		<p>By rapid multiplication of themselves they have deepened their evil conditions,
			intensified their miseries and made impotent their power as a class.</p>
		<p>Men at forty-five are thrown out of work for younger ones. Their children are forced into
			factories at an early age which could be avoided if the size of the family was
			controlled to meet the conditions of the father&#8217;s earning power.</p>
		<p>It&#8217;s the working man who has the burden of the unproductive members of his family on his
			back. He blames the capitalist for his ills, but before there was a capitalist there was
			his 
       &#8593;own&#8595;
     uncontrolled power to reproduce 
       &#8593;his numbers&#8595;
    .</p>
		<p>It has been labor&#8217;s crime against civilization that his increasing numbers has goaded
			mankind into exploitation, into frenzied industry, into child labor and into wars. To
			this cause we can trace immigration as well as most of colonization leading into warfare
			of conquest. Labor saving machinery has thrown thousands of able bodied men out of work.
			This <span class="del">[illegible one word]</span>
			
       &#8593;intolerable condition&#8595;
     was known to labor unions and economists as far back as
			the beginning of this century. All predictions were on the side of more machinery
			increasing production while decreasing the need for men or man power; yet they did
			nothing to meet this condition.</p>
		<p>They organized themselves into trade unions on the principle of limitation of numbers in
			a given trade, while the principle of limitation of numbers in the family was
			ignored.</p>
		<p>To-day there is a scramble for jobs. Too many men--too few jobs. Machinery has taken
				<span class="del">his</span>
			
       &#8593;man&#8217;s&#8595;
     place and will continue to do his work as long as man seeks comfort and
			leisure, wealth, education and happiness.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="del">The increase of Japan&#8217;s population has caused an explosion in the
				far-east with Manchuria the prize as a feeding
				ground for Japan&#8217;s growing needs.</span>
		</p>
		<p>There are so many and so various aspects to this question of Birth Control, such as the
			aspect of health, economy, race, international war and peace, that it has created a
			literature within the past fifteen years which has by no means yet been exhausted.</p>
		<p>Ignorance of Birth Control has become an acknowledged factor in infant and maternal
			mortality, unemployment, child labor, the creation of slums, overcrowding, illiteracy,
			feeblemindedness and the general lowering intelligence of our population 
       &#8593;which
				is&#8595;
     now on the increase.</p>
		<p>It is also a recognized factor in the increasing needs of charities and philanthropies.
			Huge fortunes are spent each year to meet the increasing costs of disease, dependency
			and crime.</p>
		<p>We find more <span class="del">and better</span>
			
       &#8593;individual&#8595;
     care given by Society to the defective and delinquent population
			than to the normal children of normal parents.</p>
		<p>Few, if any, known moron children go hungry, <span class="del">but</span>
			
       &#8593;while&#8595;
     thousands of normal children are undernourished and suffering from
			malnutrition. If some of the money now spent on keeping alive the insane, the
			feeble-minded and defective was divided and directed into constructive planning for race
			betterment we could soon see our way out. I&#8217;d like to see the U.S. Government pension, and offer life
			pensions, to every man and woman with a known transmissible disease who would consent to
			sterilization. By such a method we would within one generation decrease the defectives
			and decrease the vast sums now derived from taxation for their maintenance.</p>
		<p>Thus would the normal family have better opportunities for education and development and
			gradually increase their own numbers and strength.</p>
		<p>To me this need of checking the defective increase of our population is so imperative
			that immediate action is necessary and sterilization is the answer. This is one of the
			methods of birth control, but a permanent method advised only where voluntary and
			temporary methods of contraception will not be applied.</p>
		<p>If the Government could control its vast population of morons, imbeciles, paupers,
			prostitutes, criminals, feebleminded and insane, and be made to answer to the people for
			their increase, we would soon become a leading nation in civilization. Already these
			undesirable types have been banned and excluded from entrance into the country by the
				Immigration Laws of 1924, but no check has been placed on
			those already here from increasing and multiplying their numbers at will.</p>
		<p>The cost to the present government of maintaining the above mentioned population runs
			into millions, even billions, and that is not all, for as these types multiply fast,
			being nearly three times more prolific than our normal women, we are piling up huge
			debts for unborn generations to pay.</p>
		<p>So much for the subject regarding its racial or eugenic aspect. Now let us see what are
			the objections raised by our opponents.</p>
		<p>Their first cry is that it is against the laws of God. They
			refer to the biblical command of &#8220;increase and multiply and replenish the
				earth.&#8221; This command has already been fulfilled. &#8220;To replenish&#8221; means to &#8220;stock
			abundantly.&#8221; &#8220;Abundant&#8221; means &#8220;plenty&#8221;. &#8220;Plenty&#8221; means &#8220;enough&#8221;--&#8220;a sufficiency&#8221;--So
			there we see that as far as that command goes to the individual working man and woman
			their job has been done. There were only eight people on the earth when the command was
			last given. 
       &#8593;Today there are approximately 2 thousand million.&#8595;
    </p>
		<p>But the other half of that command is seldom quoted. It should read &#8220;Increase and multiply and replenish the earth that ye shall have dominion over all
				things.&#8221; &#8220;Dominion&#8221; means &#8220;authority&#8221;, &#8220;rule&#8221;, &#8220;control&#8221; over one&#8217;s own powers
			including fertility or the powers of reproduction.</p>
		<p>The next objection raised by the opposition is that Birth Control is against the laws of
			nature. Here is the most inconsistent and unreasoning assertion that any group living in
			the year 1932 can make. The laws of nature! Poor old nature! What exactly are her laws?
			The opposition assumes that certain organs like the stomach and sex organs make certain
			demands and these demands must be fulfilled, but these two organs are not the limit of
			nature&#8217;s demands. We have another organ--a brain. To use this brain, to use our
			intelligence, mind, reason, judgment, powers of choice and criticism, it just as
			important a part of nature&#8217;s machinery as to use the stomach and generative organs for
			nature&#8217;s needs.</p>
		<p>The very instinct of self-preservation and defense in applying Birth Control to protect
			health and family happiness is nature&#8217;s own weapon.</p>
		<p>The inconsistencies of objecting to birth control on the claim that it is against the
			laws of nature, are obvious when we see the very group making the strongest objections
			are bachelors who have never followed nature&#8217;s best law of mating, nor God&#8217;s law to
			increase and multiply. In every way of modern life these same people have violated
			nature&#8217;s laws for their own personal advantage and comfort and selfish purpose. They
			shave, they wear glasses, when necessary, they go to dentists, they call doctors and
			surgeons, they ride in motor cars, cook food; they wear long, clumsy, ugly gowns; they
			protect themselves against nature by all the artificial means of our modern
			civilization. By refraining from marriage they thwart one of nature&#8217;s oldest laws,
			mating. Their right to sublimate this force for their religious development is no more
			natural than to sublimate it in the interest of love and for one&#8217;s cultural development,
			as is done by the practice of birth control in family life.</p>
		<p>When the opposition&#8217;s logic is challenged regarding Gods and Nature&#8217;s Laws and the
			self-control argument met squarely, there is the usual shifting over to morals.</p>
		<p>&#8220;Yes, but what about the morals of our young people&#8221;, they query. If
			knowledge of birth control is made legal what will prevent boys and girls from getting
			it and using such knowledge for promiscuous sex relations?</p>
		<p>The assumption in this remark is that fear of pregnancy is the <span class="del">one</span>
			
       &#8593;only&#8595;
     thing that keeps young men and women from cohabiting to-day. That
			ignorance and fear are the 
       &#8593;safeguards&#8595;
     to morality. Is this the case? I do not
			believe it is true in the lives of the majority of women, though it may be true in
			certain cases where there is already a tendency to looseness in character.</p>
		<p>There is nothing in 
       &#8593;birth control&#8595;
     knowledge itself that can be called immoral.
			It is the use or misuse of knowledge which classes it as good or bad, like the use or
			misuse of 
       &#8593;any power or invention&#8595;
     razor&#8217;s, knives, guns, drugs or alcohol.</p>
		<p>But lack of the use or abuse of knowledge and power is the person. That is where we must
			begin to work if we would avoid abuses.</p>
		<p>If the Christian Church after 2000 years of teaching morals through fear of
			punishment and hell fire has not succeeded in keeping people moral, then I suggest they
			keep out of legislative, congressional halls, and give common sense, education and
			science a chance for a while. Eliminate fear and ignorance in youth. Increase
				
       &#8593;scientific&#8595;
     knowledge, 
       &#8593;develop&#8595;
    , confidence and self-respect and
			morality will take care of itself.</p>
		<p>Along with this inconsistent claim of nature comes a partial acquiescence in the practice
			of birth control by the opponents. It is one of their most astounding statements of
			ignorance and inconsistency. Birth Control? Yes, of course, but only by &#8220;self-control&#8221;
			they say. Now let us inquire what &#8220;self-control&#8221; can mean in relation to marriage. We
			are then told that there is a period of several days in a woman&#8217;s sex <span class="del">rhythm</span>
			
       &#8593;cycle&#8595;
     when it is not possible for her to conceive, but during that period it
			is not sinful for her to have sexual union. In other words, nature aims to
				
       &#8593;temporarily&#8595;
     close the gates of life by woman&#8217;s diminishing sex desire. In
			the first place it is by no means a fact that all women have a so-called &#8220;safe period.&#8221;
			It is generally agreed that less than one per cent of women can claim a &#8220;safe period.&#8221;
			In the second place, this is likely to be the period when there is no desire on the part
			of the woman for sex communion. It is the period when she should <span class="underline">not</span> be encouraged to have intercourse at all, for should she become pregnant
			at this period when her sex curve is low, she has less vitality to give to the child she
			may conceive and thereby violates one of nature&#8217;s obvious laws to protect weakened
			offspring from being born into the world.</p>
		<p>If sex union is limited to the purpose of reproduction <span class="underline">only</span>
			then a healthy married couple must consider the number of children they may properly
			rear and decently educate and confine sexual behavior to rigid rules as the stock
			breeder controls his cattle. If a loving young couple decide to marry at the age of
			23-25 with prospects of earning a good wage of $50. a week, they count the cost of
			living and decide that they will be generous to the race by bringing four children into
			the world and making decent citizens of them.</p>
		<p>The first year brings the baby into their home and if they are true to the command that
			intercourse should only be indulged in for reproduction, all 
       &#8593;affectionate&#8595;
    
			sexual behavior should cease after the first recognition that the woman is pregnant, (or
			after the first month of marriage). Absolute continence should then be the rule in that
			household if they accept that principle and furthermore there should be strict rules
			adhered to concerning sex behavior on the part of either husband or wife which would
			incline either to weaken in their discipline.</p>
		<p>Thus, they would abstain not only from intercourse, but from all demonstration of passion
			or affection. No kissing, no hugging, no cuddling. Separate rooms, separate beds,
			separate baths. No tender compliments, no lingering affectionate looks, no holding of
			hands; nothing shall be done in act or word to arouse sex love or the sex emotions in
			that continent home until such time as they know they can welcome another pregnancy and
			care for another baby!</p>
		<p>Thus, over a period of twenty-two years, when both are full of vigor, when life and love
			and passion are at its height, these two persons <span class="del">may be allowed</span>
			
       &#8593;are forbidden&#8595;
     to commune in body and soul through sexual intercourse
				<span class="del">not</span> more than four or five times throughout their twenty-five
			reproductive years. &#8220;Dost thou like the picture?&#8221;</p>
		<p>The colossal arrogance of any religious group to demand such conduct within marriage is
			beyond my understanding. The rules of the monastery and nunneries may be very well for
			single persons dedicating all their forces to religious fervor, but to lay down the same
			rules for married lovers within the home is so absurd and futile that one wonders how it
			can be countenanced by so-called intelligent people.</p>
		<p>I take issue with those who claim that sex mating is <span class="del">for the</span> sole
       &#8593;ly
				for&#8595;
     purpose of reproduction.</p>
		<p>It is a result, as we all know, but I am yet to be convinced that it is <span class="underline">the cause</span>. If one analyzes the facts a little one must
			concede that sex attraction is almost never accompanied by the wish to be a parent. Nor
			during the sex act itself seldom is there any desire to conceive. It&#8217;s the exception,
			rather than the rule, even among most primitive tribes. Barren women, pregnant women,
			sterile men 
       &#8593;&amp; women&#8595;
     have sex desires. The sex urge is as old as life
			itself. It is a tremendous thing. It is a wonderful, beautiful thing if we 
       &#8593;well
				but&#8595;
     make it so. It is a force which can not be swept back nor crushed down
			without damage to the individual. It should be accepted with reverence and pride, not
			defiled 
       &#8593;connected&#8595;
     with shame. Upon it we should build a race beautiful of
			body, sound of mind, and conscious of its power and responsibility.</p>
		<p>The new day is dawning.</p>
		<p>A new civilization is in the making. Ignorance of sex force-- creative energy has already
			given way to knowledge and enlightenment. Parenthood--conscious, enlightened and
			responsible, shall become a proud commission to carry on the torch of illumination to
			the new race. Birth Control information should be the right of every adult man and
			woman. It should be their privilege to go to the medical profession to obtain the proper
			suitable methods for prevention of conception. It should be the woman&#8217;s right to have
			knowledge, not because she is sick, diseased, or poor, but because as a woman whose body
			must be used in the creating and incubating of the new life, she should be given the
			right of choice, and time, consistent with her desires.</p>
		<p>The laws as they stand today insult our intelligence and our morals. <span class="del">and</span>
			
       &#8593;They&#8595;
     debase love. Poor women are Conscripted to child-bearing, in ignorance
			and fear, by the 
       &#8593;laws of&#8595;
     U.S. Government. They have no choice. All avenues of
			knowledge are closed to them. They must bear, regardless of consequences to their own
			health, to the welfare of the children, or to the husbands&#8217; ability to provide for
			them.</p>
		<p>Wasted lives of woman--tortured and broken in child-bearing. Twelve children born--three
			alive, twenty pregnancies with five children to show for the waste. It&#8217;s barbarous, it&#8217;s
			inhuman, it&#8217;s a waste of woman power and child life. Who gains by this? Does the church
			which opposes knowledge gain power thus? Who pays for it? The women pay for it, my
			friends. They pay personally and directly for this, <span class="del">Brutality, which coarsens every
				fibre of a Society which should be humane. </span>in infant and maternal mortality,
			in child labor, in wasted bodies, futile pregnancies, still born babies, and abortions.
			In ignorance she brings forth her children and is enslaved as the black race never was
			enslaved. Where is another Abraham Lincoln to
			free her?</p>
