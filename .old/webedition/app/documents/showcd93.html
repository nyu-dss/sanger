            <div class="epigraph-line"> &#8220;Every night and every morn<br> Some to misery are born<br> Every
                    morn and every night<br> Some are born to sweet delight<br> Some are born to
                    sweet delight<br> Some are born to endless night.&#8221;<br> -William Blake</div>
        
        <p>During my early years in New York trained nurses were
            in great demand. Few people wanted to enter hospitals; they were afraid they might be
            &#8220;practiced&#8221; upon, and consented to go only in desperate emergencies. Sentiment was
            especially vehement in the matter of having babies. A woman&#8217;s own bedroom, no matter how
            inconveniently arranged, was the usual place for her lying in. I was not sufficiently
            free from domestic duties to be a general nurse, but I could ordinarily manage
            obstetrical cases, because I was notified far enough ahead to plan my schedule. And
            after two weeks, I could go home again.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I was summoned to small apartments occupied by young clerks, insurance
            salesmen, or lawyers just starting out, most of them under thirty, whose wives were
            having their first or second baby. They were always eager to know the best and latest
            method in infant-care and feeding. In particular, Jewish patients whose lives centered
            around the family, welcomed advice and followed it implicitly.</p>
        <p>But more and more my calls began to come from the lower East Side, as though I were being
            magnetically drawn there by some force outside my control. I hated the wretchedness and
            hopelessness of the poor, and never experienced that satisfaction in working among them
            that so many noble women have found. My concern for my patients was now quite different
            from my earlier hospital attitude. I could see that much was wrong with them which did
            not appear in the physiological or medical diagnosis. A woman in childbirth was not
            merely a woman in childbirth. My expanded outlook included a view of her background, her
            potentialities as a human being, the kind of children she was bearing, and what was
            going to happen to them.</p>
        <p>The wives of small shopkeepers were my most frequent cases, but I had the wives of
            carpenters, truck-drivers, dishwashers, and pushcart vendors. I admired intensely 
	[<em>one word </em>]
	 consideration most of these people had 
	[<em>one word </em>]
	
            their own. Money to pay doctor and nurse had been carefully saved months in
            advance--parents-in-law, grandfathers, grandmothers, all contributing.</p>
        <p>As soon as the neighbors learned that a nurse was in the building, they came in a
            friendly way to visit, often carrying fruit, jellies or gefilte fish made after a cherished recipe. It was infinitely pathetic to
            me that they, so poor themselves, should bring me food. Later they drifted in again with
            the excuse of getting the plate, and sat down for a nice talk; there was no hurry.
            Always back of the little gift was the request: &#8220;I am pregnant (or my
                daughter, or my sister is). Tell me something to keep from having another baby. We
                cannot afford another yet.&#8221;</p>
        <p>I tried to explain the only two methods I had ever heard of among the middle classes,
            both of which were invariably brushed aside as unacceptable. They were of no certain
            avail to the wife, because they placed the burden of responsibility solely upon the
            husband--a burden which he seldom assured. What she was seeking was self-protection she
            could herself use, and there was none.</p>
        <p>Below this stratum of society was one in truly desperate circumstances. The men were
            sullen and unskilled, picking up odd jobs now and then, but more often unemployed,
            lounging in and out of the house at all hours of the day and night. The women seemed to
            slink on their way to market, and were without neighborliness.</p>
        <p>These submerged, untouched classes were beyond the scope of organized charity or
            religion. No labor union, no church, not even the Salvation Army reached
            them. They were apprehensive of everyone, and rejected help of any kind, ordering all
            intruders to keep out; both birth and death they considered their own business. Social
            agents, who were just beginning to appear, were profoundly distrusted because they pried
            into homes and lives, asking questions about wages, how many were in the family, and had
            any of them ever been in jail. Often two or three had been there, or were now under
            suspicion of prostitution, shoplifting, purse-snatching, or petty thievery; and in
            consequence they passed furtively by the big blue uniforms on the corner.</p>
        <p>The utmost depression came over me as I approached this surreptitious region. Below
            Fourteenth Street I seemed to be breathing a different air, to be in another world and
            country, where the people had habits and customs alien to anything I had ever heard
            about.</p>
        <p>There were then approximately ten thousand apartments in New York into which no sun-ray
            penetrated directly; such windows as they had opened only on a narrow court from which
            rose fetid odors. It was seldom cleaned, though garbage and refuse often went down into
            it. All these dwellings were pervaded by the foul breath of poverty, that moldy,
            indefinable, indescribable smell which cannot be fumigated out, sickening to me but
            apparently unnoticed by those who lived there. When I set to work with antiseptics,
            their pungent sting, at least temporarily obscured the stench.</p>
        <p>I remember one confinement case to which I was called by the doctor of an insurance
            company. I climbed up the five flights and entered the airless rooms, but the baby had
            come with too great speed. A boy of ten had been the only assistant.</p>
        <p>Many families took in &#8220;boarders,&#8221; as they were termed, whose small contributions paid the
            rent. These derelicts, wanderers, alternately working and drinking, were crowded in with
            the children; a single room sometimes held as many as six sleepers. Little girls were
            accustomed to dressing and undressing in front of the men.</p>
        <p>Pregnancy was a chronic condition among the women of this class. Suggestions as to what
            to do for a girl who was &#8220;in trouble,&#8221; or a married woman who was &#8220;caught,&#8221; passed from
            mouth to mouth. When they had word of a new remedy, they hurried to the drug-store, and
            if the clerk were inclined to be friendly, he might say: &#8220;Oh, that won&#8217;t help you, but
            here&#8217;s something that may.&#8221; The younger druggists usually refused to give advice
            because, if it were to be known, they would come under the law; midwives were even more
            fearful. The doomed women implored me to reveal the &#8220;secret&#8221; that rich people had,
            offering to pay me extra to tell them; many really believed I was holding back
            information for money.</p>
        <p>Each time I returned to this district, which was becoming a recurrent nightmare, I used
            to hear that Mrs. Cohen &#8220;had been
                carried to a hospital, but had never come back,&#8221; or that Mrs. Kelly &#8220;had sent the children to a
                neighbor and had put her head into the gas oven.&#8221; Day after day such tales were
            poured into my ears--a baby born dead, great relief; the death of an older child--sorrow
            but again relief of a sort. I shuddered with horror as I listened to the details and
            studied the reasons back of them--destitution linked with excessive childbearing. The
            waste of life seemed utterly senseless. One by one, worried, sad, pensive and alone,
            they marshaled themselves before me in my dreams, sometimes appealingly, sometimes
            accusingly.</p>
        <p>These were not merely &#8220;unfortunate conditions among the poor&#8221; such as we read about. I
            knew the women personally. They were living, breathing, human beings, with hopes, fears
            and aspirations like my own; yet their weary, misshapen bodies, &#8220;always ailing, never
            failing,&#8221; were destined to be thrown on the scrap-heap before they were thirty-five. I
            could not escape from the facts of their wretchedness; neither was I able to see any way
            out. My own cozy and comfortable family existence was becoming a reproach to me.</p>
        <p>Then one stifling mid-July day of 1912 I was summoned to a Grand Street tenement. My
            patient was a small, slight Russian Jewess, about
            twenty-eight years old, of the special cast of feature to which suffering lends a
                Madonna-like expression. The cramped three-room
            apartment was in a sorry state of turmoil. The man, a truck-driver scarcely older than
            this wife, had come home to find the three children crying and his wife unconscious. He
            called the nearest doctor, who in turn had sent for me. The husband&#8217;s earning were
            trifling, and most of them had gone to keep the none-too-strong children clean and
            properly fed. But his wife&#8217;s ingenuity had helped them to save a little, and this he was
            glad to spend on a nurse rather than have her go to a hospital.</p>
        <p>The doctor and I settled ourselves to the task of fighting the septicemia. Never had I
            worked so fast, never so concentratedly. The sultry days and nights were melted into a
            torpid inferno. It did not seem possible there could be such heat; and every bit of
            food, ice and drugs had to be carried up three flights of stairs.</p>
        <p>Jake was more kind and thoughtful than many of the
            husbands I had encountered. He loved his children, and had always helped his wife wash
            and dress them. He had brought water up and carried garbage down before he left in the
            morning, and did as much as he could for me while he anxiously watched her progress.</p>
        <p>After a fortnight, the wife&#8217;s recovery was in sight. Neighbors were genuinely pleased
            that she had survived. She smiled wanly at all who came to see her and thanked them
            gently, but she could not respond to their hearty congratulations. She appeared to be
            more despondent and anxious than she should have been, and spent too much time in
            meditation.</p>
        <p>At the end of three weeks, as I was preparing to leave the fragile patient to take up her
            difficult life once more, she finally voiced her fears; &#8220;Another baby
                will finish me, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too early to talk about that,&#8221; I temporized.</p>
        <p>But when the doctor came to make his last call, I drew him aside.</p>
        <p>&#8220;She is terribly worried about having another baby.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;She well may be,&#8221; replied the doctor; and then he stood before her and
            said: &#8220;Any more such capers, young woman, and there&#8217;ll be no need for
                me.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;I know, Doctor,&#8221; she replied timidly. &#8220;But,&#8221;--and
            she hesitated as though it took all her courage to say it--&#8220;what can I do
                to prevent it?&#8221;</p>
        <p>The doctor was a kindly man and he had worked hard to save her, but such incidents had
            become so familiar to him that he had long since lost whatever delicacy he might once
            have had. He laughed good-naturedly. &#8220;You want to have your cake and eat it
                too, do you? Well, it can&#8217;t be done.&#8221;</p>
        <p>I glanced quickly at the wife. Even through my sudden tears I could see stamped on her
            face an expression of absolute despair. We simply looked at each other, saying no word
            until the door had closed behind the doctor. Then she lifted her thin, blue-veined hands
            and clasped them beseechingly.</p>
        <p>"He can&#8217;t understand. He&#8217;s only a man. But you do, don&#8217;t you? Please tell
                me the secret, and I&#8217;ll never breathe it to a soul. Please!&#8221;</p>
        <p>What was I to do? I could not speak the conventionally comforting phrases which would be
            of no comfort. Instead, I made her as physically easy as I could, and promised to come
            back in a few days to talk with her again.</p>
        <p>Night after night her wistful image appeared before me. I made all sorts of excuses to
            myself for not going back. I was busy on other cases; I really did not know what to say
            to her or how to convince her of my own ignorance; I was helpless to avert such
            monstrous atrocities. Time rolled by, and I did nothing.</p>
        <p>The telephone rang one evening three months later, and Jake&#8217;s agitated voice begged me to
            come at once; his wife was sick again and from the same cause. For a wild moment I
            thought of sending someone else; but actually, of course, I hurried into my uniform,
            caught up my bag, and started out. All the way I longed for a subway wreck, an
            explosion, anything to keep me from having to enter that home again. But nothing
            happened, even to delay me. I turned into the dingy doorway and climbed the familiar
            stairs once more. The children were there, young little things.</p>
        <p>The wife was in a coma, and died within ten minutes. I folded her still hands across her
            breast, remembering how they had pleaded with me, begging so humbly for the knowledge
            which was her right. I drew a sheet over her pallid face. Jake was sobbing, running his
            hands through his hair and pulling it out like an insane person. Over and over again he
            wailed, &#8220;My God! My God! My God!&#8221;</p>
        <p>I left him pacing desperately back and forth, and for hours I myself walked and walked
            and walked through the hushed streets. When I finally arrived home and let myself
            quietly in, all the household was sleeping. I stood looking out of my window and down
            upon the dimly lighted city.</p>
        <p>Its pains and griefs crowded in upon me; a moving picture rolled before my eyes with
            photographic clearness; women writhing in travail to bring forth little babies; the
            babies themselves naked and hungry, wrapped in newspapers to keep them from the cold;
            six-year-old children with pinched, pale, wrinkled faces, old in concentrated
            wretchedness, pushed into gray and fetid cellars, crouching on stone floors, their small
            scrawny hands scuttling through rags, making lamp-shades, artificial flowers; white
            coffins, black coffins, coffins, coffins interminably passing in never-ending
            succession. The scenes piled one upon another on another. I could bear it no longer.</p>
        <p>As I stood there, the darkness faded. The sun came up and threw its reflection over the
            house-tops. It was the dawn of a new day in my life also. The doubt and questioning, the
            experimenting and trying, were now to be put behind me. I knew I could not go back
            merely to keeping people alive.</p>
        <p>I went to bed, knowing that no matter what it might cost, I was finished with palliatives
            and superficial cures; I was resolved to seek out the root of evil, to do something to
            change the destiny of mothers whose miseries were vast as the sky.</p>
        <p>How were mothers to be saved? I went through many revolving doors, looked around, and not
            finding what I was seeking, came out again. I talked incessantly to everyone who seemed
            to have social welfare at heart. Progressive women whom I consulted were thoroughly
            discouraging. &#8220;Wait until we get the vote. Then we&#8217;ll take care of
                that,&#8221; they assured me. I tried the Socialists. Here, there, and everywhere the
            reply came: &#8220;Wait until women have more education. Wait until we secure
                equal distribution of wealth.&#8221; Wait for this and wait for that. Wait! Wait!
            Wait!</p>
        <p>Having no idea how powerful were the laws which laid a blanket of ignorance over the
            medical profession as well as the laity, I asked various doctors of my acquaintance:
            &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t physicians doing something? Information does exist, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Perhaps; but I doubt whether you can find it. Even if you do, you can&#8217;t
                pass it on. Comstock&#8217;ll get you if you
                don&#8217;t watch out.&#8221;</p>
        <p>In order to ascertain something about this subject which was so mysterious and so
            unaccountably forbidden, I spent almost a year in the libraries--the Astor, the Lenox, the Academy of Medicine, the Library of
                Congress and dozens of others. Hoping that psychological treatises might
            inform me, I read Auguste Forel and Iwan Block. At one gulp I swallowed Havelock Ellis&#8217; &#8220;Psychology of
                Sex,&#8221; and had psychic indigestion for months thereafter.</p>
        <p>I read translations from the German in which women were advised to have more children
            because it could be proved statistically that their condition was improved by
            childbearing. The only article on the question I could discover in American literature
            was in the Atlantic Monthly, by Edward Alsworth Ross of the University of
                Wisconsin, who brought to the attention of his readers the decline of the
            birth-rate among the upper and educated classes, and the increase among the unfit, the
            consequences of which were sure to be race-suicide.</p>
        <p>The pursuit of my quest took me away from home a good deal. The children used to come in
            after school and at once hunt for me. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Mother?&#8221; was the usual
            question. If they found me at my mending-basket, they all leaped about for joy, took
            hands and danced, shouting: &#8220;Mother&#8217;s home, Mother&#8217;s home, Mother&#8217;s
                sewing.&#8221; Sewing seemed to imply a measure of performance.</p>
        <p>I too wanted to drive away the foreboding barrier of separation by closer contact with
            them. I wanted to have them solely to myself, to feed, to bathe, to clothe them myself.
            I had heard of the clean, wind-swept Cape Cod dunes,
            which appeared to be as far from the ugliness of civilization as I could get. Socialism,
            anarchism, syndicalism, progressivism--I was tired of them all. At the end of the
            spring, thoroughly depressed and dissatisfied, I tucked the children under my arms,
            boarded a Fall River boat, and sailed off, a pioneer to Provincetown.</p>
        <p>In 1913 the tip of the Cape was only a fishing village with one planked walk--which, I
            was told, had been paid for by Congress. Up and
            down its length walked the bellman, the last of the town criers, proclaiming the
            news.</p>
        <p>At first we lived in the upper story of a fisherman&#8217;s house right on the water. After he
            went out in the morning, his wife and her children, and I and mine, were left alone.
            Then the old women recalled scenes from their early days on the whaling vessels. Their
            mothers had brought them forth unaided; and their own sons, in turn, had been born on
            the ships and apprenticed to their husbands. They fitted into life simply; but the
            younger Portuguese, who were taking over the fishing industry, were asking what they
            should do about limiting their families.</p>
        <p>The village was rather messy and smelled of fish. I was still too close to humanity and
            wanted to be more alone, so we moved to the extreme end of town. Our veranda faced the
            Bay, and when the tide was high, the water came up and lapped at the piles on which the
            cottage was built. Stuart, Grant and Peggy
            used to sit on the steps and dabble their toes. At low tide they had two miles of beach
            on which to skip and run; it was a wonderful place to play, and all summer we had
            sunrise breakfasts, sunset picnics.</p>
        <p>I spent the entire season at Provincetown, groping for knowledge, classifying all my past
            activities in their proper categories, weighing the pros and cons of what good there was
            in them and also what they lacked. It was a period of gestation. Just as you give birth
            to a child, so you can give birth to an idea.</p>
        <p>Between interims of brooding and playing with the children, I took part in the diversions
            of the minute colony of congenial people. Charles
                Hawthorne had a school of painting; Mary
                Heaton Vorse and her husband Joseph
                O&#8217;Brien were there; so also were Hutch
                Hapgood and Neith Boyce. Jessie Ashley had lifted Big Bill Haywood out of the slough of the
            Paterson strike and brought him down to rest and recuperate.</p>
        <p>Big Bill was one of the few who saw what I was aiming at, although fearful that my future
            might involve the happiness of my children. Even he did not feel that the small-family
            question was significant enough to be injected into the labor platform. Nevertheless, as
            we rambled up and down the beach, he came to my aid with that encouragement of which I
            was badly in need. He suggested I go to France and see for myself the
            conditions resulting from generations of family limitation in that country. This struck
            me as a splendid idea, because it would also give Bill
                Sanger a chance to paint, instead of continuing to build suburban
            houses.</p>
        <p>The trip to Europe seemed so urgent that no matter what sacrifices had to
            be made, we decided to make them.</p>
