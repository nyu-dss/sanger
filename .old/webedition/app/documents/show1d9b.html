		</p><p class="headnote">Sanger accepted her nomination as president of the International
                Planned Parenthood Federation in Stockholm, Sweden in August of
            1953 at the Fourth International Conference on Planned Parenthood.The last pages are missing.</p><hr>
    
    
    
        <p>This nomination as First President of the <span class="del">Fourth</span>International PP Federation is
            indeed a great honor. I had hoped &amp; prayed since the Bombay Conference that the Presidency would be
            accepted by that charming, able woman Lady Rama
                Rau. </p>
        <p>She has given her reason why she can not accept the position &amp; hope that in the next
            two years when we meet again that these difficulties will evaporate &amp; be gone
            forever. </p>
        <p>This had been a splendid conference. I appreciate &amp; congratulate the German delegates
            for their presence here. I know what difficulties they must overcome to speak out on the
            subject. But it is not easy to keep truth buried behind laws forever &amp; I believe
            that when the general people get on their feet again -- time movement will gain
            strength. I also thank the Dutch delegation for their splendid cooperation. Their
            understanding has indeed made the work of the Steering
                Committee a pleasure. </p>
        <p>We must also thank the delegates from Greece, Turkey,
                Japan for their presence here. </p>
        <p>The splendid accommodations that the Swedish League has made for us. Their hospitality, their organizing ability
            give us hope that one day there may be a cooperative well ordered world where PP becomes
            a pattern of our civilization -- Mrs. Ottensen
                Jensen&#8217;s great heart &amp; love has made us all feel equal to the task
            which is ahead of us as we separate &amp; return to our homes to carry on. </p>
        <p>Last may I say that we all owe a debt of gratitude for the skilled &amp; able
            demonstrations of fairness. Chairman Dr. Blacker,
            -- Dr. Blacker has worked long hours on the Constitution I wrote him &amp; requested
            that he &amp; the English
                Committee set up the form of an International Constitution for
            this Conference which could be passed around to the various nationals for their
            opinions &amp; comments. This was done &amp; I know it took the midnight time to set it
            forth in so splendid a form for our discussions. </p>
        <p>We have all discussed every point &amp; with a few changes or additions I am pleased that
            this Constitution has been accepted. As to myself -- I can only say that my heart is too
            full to express my gratitude for this confidence &amp; honor -- that you have bestowed
            upon me. I am of the nature that I do not spread my interests. I shall be happy to take
            this Presidency for the next two years or until the next conference meets. I shall ask
            for your cooperation as well as your criticisms, your opinions &amp; what ever you think
            I may do to further the work &amp; direct its </p>
