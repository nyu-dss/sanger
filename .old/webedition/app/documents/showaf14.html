        <h1>HUMBLE PIE</h1>
        <p>The Postmaster did not like the first number of
            the WOMAN REBEL. He even took the trouble to tell the
                WOMAN REBEL so. He advised her not to send any more
            copies through the United States mails. He
            said the WOMAN REBEL was unmailable under Section 211 of
            the Criminal Code, as amended by the act of March 4, 1911. Of course the Postmaster was
            acting within his rights. He is empowered by the federal government to stop the
            circulation of any printed expression of honest convictions. It is a crime to have
            honest convictions in these United States. It is a crime to express them
            publicly. It is a crime to send them through the mails. Therefore the WOMAN REBEL has not yet been informed which of her views were
            so displeasing to the Postmaster, but whatever they were, she hastens to agree with the
            Postmaster that she was absolutely mistaken in these views. She realizes that the Postoffice is always "right," since it has the
            monopolized POWER to enforce that "right." Therefore the WOMAN
                REBEL, humbled and repentant, curtseys coyly to the Postmaster and
            apologizes for the expression of any opinion that is unmailable under Section 211 of the Criminal Code as
            amended by the act of March 4, 1911.</p>
        <p>The WOMAN REBEL has decided to be patriotic. It pays, you
            know. If, last month, the WOMAN REBEL suggested "race
            control" the daily papers discreetly expressed the problem, this month she switches over
            for large families, like Mr. Roosevelt. This
            great and glorious country needs children--to uphold its great and glorious industrial
            system, its great and glorious public schools, its great and glorious silk mills and
            mush factories, its great and glorious, its magnificently equipped, and efficiently
            conducted asylums for the insane and feeble-minded, its reformatories and juvenile
            courts, its noble slums. Let us sing "My Country, Tis of
            Thee!" And "My Country Tis of Thee" is mailable under
            Section 211 of the Criminal Code as amended by the act of March 4, 1911.</p>
        <p>In order to comply with the rules and regulations of the government, the WOMAN REBEL may be forced to become indecent and to advocate
            a total ignorance of Sexual Hygiene for woman. As the purpose of the WOMAN REBEL is to stimulate her readers <span class="bold">to
                think for themselves</span>, and to act according to their own convictions, let them
            be not surprised or dismayed at her mildness and meekness this month. Mildness and
            meekness, the attributes of a feeble mentality, are mailable according to Section 211 of
            the Criminal Code as amended by the act of March 4, 1911. This suppression may not be as
            important to you as to us, for you are not suppressed. Do not forget that you have a
            voice to protest and fight against a censorship that is busy suppressing scientific
            truths that the working people are demanding.</p>
