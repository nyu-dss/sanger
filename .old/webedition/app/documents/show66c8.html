        <h1>WHAT EVERY GIRL SHOULD KNOW</h1>
        <h3>By Margaret H. Sanger. </h3>
        <h2>Puberty--Part I.</h2>
        <p>Puberty is the age at which the girl or boy becomes capable of reproduction. Writers
            differ in the use of the word. Many use it to denote the whole period of time during
            which the procreative ability continues which is usually from the 14th to the 45th year.
            There are still other uses of the word, but we will use it as the age when the boy or
            girl becomes sexually matured or ripe, the first indication of which is the menstrual
            flow in the girl and seminal emissions in the boy.</p>
        <p>This age of puberty is celebrated by initiations among savage peoples, mostly for the
            purpose of trying the powers of endurance in the boy or girl. The boy is taken away
            among strange tribes, is subjected to the greatest physical pain and hardship, and among
            some tribes is circumcised. The girl is often subjected to a vaginal incision and should
            she cry out or show any sign of suffering she is disgraced among the women of her tribe
            and promptly expelled from the settlement. In Ellis' Psychology of Sex the author relates of
            the Yuman Indians of California how the girls prepare for marriage at the
            first sign of menstruation by being wrapped in blankets and placed in a warm pit for
            four days and nights. The old women of the tribe dance about them and sing constantly;
            they give away coin, cloth and wheat to teach the girls generosity, and sow wild seeds
            broadcast over the girls to cause them to be prolific. These and various other
            initiations are practiced by nearly all savage tribes. The boys and girls receive their
            sex knowledge at this time, and are instructed in the duties of married life.</p>
        <p>The girls are fully informed of the menstruation. It has been said the knowledge of
            sexual relations is openly discussed and naturally taught; that therefore, it has no
            glamour for men, and that in consequence the women of these tribes are virtuous. </p>
        <p>Perhaps you will wonder what bearing all this has on What Every
                Girl Should Know. I relate it only to show that the savages have recognized
            the importance of plain sexual talks to their young for ages, while civilization is
            still hiding itself under the black pall of prudery.</p>
        <p>When we speak of puberty it is necessary to have some knowledge of the organs of
            reproduction and their structure. So far the physiology taught in the public schools has
            not treated of these organs. In order to get books on this subject a girl is met with
            the question: "Are you a nurse or physician?" If not, the books are denied her.
            Consequently the average girl is kept in ignorance of the function of these organs, and
            is at a loss to know where to go for clean information. It is necessary, therefore, to
            give this information here, without mincing words, if there is any benefit to be derived
            from the following articles. It is very simple for the girl to learn the correct names
            of these organs and call them by such names. They are the ovaries, fallopian tubes,
            uterus, vagina and breasts. The breasts were not always classed as reproductive organs,
            but later writers recognize their relation to them, and as such they are now
            included.</p>
        <p>Let us first take the ovaries, which are two small glands about the size and shape of an
            almond, placed one at each side of the extreme lower part of the woman's abdomen. They
            are imbedded in large muscles which also help to hold the uterus (the womb) in place.
            Inside the ovaries are thousands of little eggs called ovules, which have been there
            since the birth of the girl. The work of the ovary is to develop and mature these eggs,
            and send them on to be fertilized. At the time of puberty, these eggs are all in
            different stages of development. Those in the center of the ovary ripen first and burst
            through the outer cover of the ovary (which is like a capsule and at the time of
            menstruation becomes swollen and congested). The ovule is caught by the fringy ends of
            the fallopian tubes, which are in a constant lashing motion, which motion sends the egg
            through the tube to the uterus.</p>
        <p>The fallopian tubes join the ovaries to the upper and outer angle of the uterus.
            Sometimes the sperm cell from the male comes up into the tube to meet the egg and it is
            fertilized here, but this is not the nest nature has prepared for the egg's development,
            and unless it returns into the uterus it causes serious trouble and an operation is
            necessary. Impregnation in the tube is very rare, but it is possible.</p>
        <p>The uterus, often spoken of as the womb, is a hollow muscular organ into which the egg
            comes from the tubes to be fertilized. After fertilization it remains here, is nourished
            and developed until it can develop no more. Then it is thrown out by the contraction of
            the muscles, which process we call the birth of the child. The uterus is about three
            inches long, its shape is like a pear with the small end downward. It is not fastened to
            any of the bony parts, but is held in place by the ligaments and muscles, which also
            allow it to move with different movements of the body. One of the most interesting
            features about the uterus which is so small in its cavity is that it can attach to
            accommodate the growing child within it to the length of nineteen to twenty-one inches.
            This is because it is one and one-half inches thick and composed of layers of muscles
            which are tough and yet elastic. At the upper side of the uterus are the openings into
            the fallopian tubes. At the small end of uterus is another opening leading into the
            vagina. It is through this opening the sperm of the male comes in order to fertilize the
            egg. Thus you can readily see the uterus is the nest or cradle where the egg is to live
            until it becomes strong enough to subsist on other nourishment.</p>
        <p>The vagina is a muscular tube-like passage which extends from the small part of the
            uterus (called the neck) to the outer surface of the body where its opening is usually
            partly closed in virgins by a thin membrane or film known as the hymen. The walls of the
            vagina are also very thick and elastic. This is sometimes called the birth canal. The
            hymen was for years a subject for discussion in the professional world among physicians.
            In my talks to girls I find it a subject of great interest and often anxiety to many of
            them, for the average girl seems possessed with the old idea that the presence of the
            hymen is necessary to marital happiness. The time was not long ago when its absence was
            considered cause for serious discord between husband and wife, and I have been told that
            under the old law its absence was sufficient ground for divorce.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, modern science has thrown some light on this subject and disproved the
            theory that its absence was necessarily due to a woman's having had sexual relations.
            There are cases on record of women who have lived four and five years in prostitution
            who were found with perfectly preserved hymen. It is important to know that it differs
            in size and shape in women. Also, that in some women it has been entirely absent since
            birth. It can be destroyed by accident or injured by operations, or examinations where
            the physician did not use the greatest care. In some women it is easily destroyed; in
            others it is more difficult. It is not at all uncommon for a physician to find the hymen
            unruptured when he comes to deliver the first born child. All of which goes to prove
            that neither its presence nor its absence is necessarily the sign of virginity.</p>
        <p>Now that we have some idea of the situation of the reproductive organs and their
            relations to one another we shall be ready next week to consider in greater detail the
            ovule or egg in the ovary.</p>
        (To be continued.)
