		<h1>SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION IN SPAIN.</h1>
		<p>THE term "free-thinker" applied to one in Spain is considered a mark of
			advanced ideas. Other terms such as "liberal", "republican", are used to classify
			certain stages of one's development, which to an American seem like relics of a past
			age. The free-thinker who is accepted by all respectables as <span class="italics">the</span> most progressive is in reality usually a generation behind in general
			phases of thought. </p>
		<p>It is the Anarchist in Spain who is alive to the broader interests of life, and it is and
			has been the anarchists who have done more in proportion to their number to educate and
			to promote a desire for education amongst the working people, than any other
			organization. They are the only educators who offer to the Spanish people a program of
			life and society which naturally applies to the Spanish temperament as well as being
			consistent with their conduct.</p>
		<p>If we can realize what it means to attempt to educate a people where in a population of
			17,667,256 there are 11,945,971 out of that number who are illiterate, who can neither
			read nor write, then one may be able to understand the importance of the work of the
			Anarchist propaganda and the difficulties which confronted Francisco Ferrer. It is impossible to separate
			Anarchism from Spanish education or from anything which is important in Spain, for it is
			the only spark of life there today. It will be left to the Anarchist to drive out the
			priests and the robbers, before Spain can step freely in any direction.</p>
		<p>Organized anarchy in Spain dates back to the year 1868, when the International
				Association of Workers was formed, the result of which was the First National
			Congress held in Barcelona in 1870. So great was
			the interest in these ideals and so rapidly did they spread, that the following year the
			Government declared the International to be an illegal organization and the executive
			left Spanish soil and fled to Portugal. A Portugese organization was soon
			established and the ideas flourished on both soils. </p>
		<p>In spite of the law declaring the International Association of Workers illegal, several
			conferences were held throughout Spain. The movement became so strong and general that
			the Republicans attempted to capture it by swinging it into a political groove, but
			failed. The Spaniard has little faith in government, no matter what its brand, so they
			kept to one straight issue-- Revolution through economic action. They supported Bakunin at the famous Conference at Geneva in 1873 in this. </p>
		<p>The Government realized the importance of the movement when it saw it could not be
			side-tracked into a political camp. The issue was too straight to be tolerated, at all
			costs it must be crushed; it accordingly took steps to disolve it and smash the
			organization by arresting and banishing the prominent members to penal settlements in
			the Marianne Islands. This had the
			desired effect and many members abandoned the movement entirely, while others simple
			withdrew their activities. For several years it remained at a standstill until in 1889,
			when a new programme was drawn up upon which was based Modern Anarchism in Spain.</p>
		<p>I will not attempt to tell of the hardships, strifes and struggles of these who were able
			to keep the propaganda current and the ideals alive in the face of persecutions,
			tortures and executions. There was no conceivable plot which the criminal tactics of the
			police and the priests did not resort to in order to incriminate sympathizers and to
			extinguish anarchist ideals. Whole issues of both daily and weekly papers were
			confiscated by the government day after day and week after week.</p>
		<p>One anarchist four-page daily, "Tierra Y'Libertad", (Land and Liberty), which in 1905 had a circulation of 10,000
			copies, had to be converted into a weekly with 8,000 copies. This is only one instance
			-- there are many others -- but it is estimated very roughly and conservatively that at
			the present time there are more than 70,000 copies of current anarchist papers, weekly,
			daily, etc., and we know there are always two or three readers to every purchase, which
			goes to prove that suppression and confiscation may delay or hold back for a time, but
			ideals cannot be killed and often take root while they stand.</p>
		<p>Anarchists attribute the poverty, ignorance and misery to present day society. They
			believe a society can be established in which Law, authority, government or church shall
			not dictate or regulate human conduct, but that mutual help through natural desires will
			give individual freedom.</p>
		<p>Spanish Anarchism embraces the philosophy of Bakunin, Reclus and Kropotkin. They
			consistently advocate the general strike to bring about the social revolution.</p>
