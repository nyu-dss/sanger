        <p>Dear Friends of the Human Betterment Federation of Des Moines:</p>
        <p>It is with regret that I can not be present at your Annual Meeting to tell you how much I
            admire your efforts in your Educational Campaign to prevent parents or would-be parents
            from passing on to unborn generations the inheritable diseases they themselves are
            afflicted.</p>
        <p>&#8220;Children should not be born to men or women who are insane, feebleminded or have other
            transmissable diseases. Such individuals, tragic as it may seem, should never become
            parents. Children born of such parents are likely to inherit the same or similar
            diseases and thus become a problem not only in schools as the parental guidance is
            lacking or nil, but create problems in each country. Such children form our army of
            delinquents and become social burdens, ending their lives in institutions, such as
            reform schools and Penitentiaries.</p>
        <p>It is my firm belief that men and women of mental or physical maladjustment <span class="underline">would not want</span> to bring children into the world with their
            handicaps if they knew <span class="underline">how</span> to prevent it. There is no use
            expecting this group of people to practice contraception. The risk is too great. There
            should be permanent protection such as sterilization. This operation is so simple and
            uncomplicated the wonder is why we continue to allow feebleminded parents, morons, and
            insane persons to increase and multiply when the simple method of closing the fallopian
            tubes in the woman and the vas deferens or spermatic duct in the man to prevent the
            passage of the ova and the sperm cells may be used. When this <span class="del">operation</span> is
            performed by a competent physician, the male tubes are closed by a slight operation in a
            few minutes. No hospitalization is necessary. The man usually returns to his work the
            same day. It does not call for the removal of any organ in either man or woman. Sex
            relations are in no way hampered. All the functions of the organs continue as usual
            except the exit of the ova or sperms. These are absorbed in the system without knowledge
            or consciousness of the person or patient.</p>
        <p>There are 27 states in this U.S.A. whose legislators
            have been far sighted and fearless enough to provide the cost of sterilization at Government expense in such cases where there is
            a hereditary disease. Each case is reviewed by a Board of Experts, known as the
                State Eugenic Board. Patients welcome this helpful protection for
            themselves, not only feebleminded but men and women known as congenital criminals, apply
            for this protection before going out on Parole. Over 98% of the 1500 sterilization
            operations reported in 1949 were on file as both patient or inmate and members of the
            family had made the application for the operation.</p>
        <p>It is a cruel and wasteful system in our National Economy to keep on generation after
            generation retaining in institutions insane, feebleminded, mental defectives. Often
            parents of these inmates were also institutionalized and generations following will
            follow the same path. All these Institutions are over-crowded and waiting lists of some
            who seriously need the care but are excluded for want of room. There are thousands of
            inmates in these institutions throughout the U.S.A. whose energies and abilities could
            be used outside the institutions were they rendered infertile by sterilization.</p>
        <p>In the early days of my campaign for birth control education I listed sterilization as
            the one permanent, harmless and safe method which, once accepted and accomplished, the
            problem of 
       &#8593;a contraceptive&#8595;
     method was solved.</p>
        <p>As regarding new ideas, there was and still is much misunderstanding regarding
            sterilization. Men in particular are apt to shun the idea thinking it may render him
            less potent sexually. That idea is erroneous and false and should be corrected.
            Sterilization is not to be confused with castration, an operation in which sex glands
            are removed and the individual is definitely left impotent or sexless. But Sterilization
            does in no way interfere with sexual potency and in all cases recorded a fully
            satisfactory married life continues. It should be the responsibility of our Public Health officials to inform
            themselves regarding inmates of our institution and it should be their public duty to
            see that inmates applying for parole should be 
       &#8593;voluntarily&#8595;
     sterilized before
            they leave the Institution. A proper sympathetic lecture to these inmates regarding the
            benefits of sterilization would bring their consent and acquiescence to the operation
                
       &#8593;as has been shown in reports in California. &#8595;
    
            <span class="del">Mrs. Sanger</span>
            
       &#8593;I want to&#8595;
     congratulate the Federation on its splendid educational campaigns
            awakening the public as to the danger to our civilization to allow the perpetuation of
            hereditary diseases to the innocent unborn children. The regular methods of
            contraception are used easily by parents whose intelligence and responsibility are
            adequate to its application but sterilization is a better method in cases where the
            persons mentality is not adequate for the usually technique necessary in regular birth
            control methods. It also should be used when inheritable defects of heart or damage to
            heart, lungs, or kidneys make motherhood dangerous. There is also an inheritable
            blindness and other diseases when parents-to-be should be informed of the dangers which
            may be passed on to innocent children. Sterilization <span class="del">would</span>
            
       &#8593;should&#8595;
     be advised and recommended by the medical advisors. Society has the
            right to expect our Public Health officials to protect it from transmissable diseases
            just as it protects us today from contagious diseases like diphtheria, measles, small
            pox, etc.</p>
        <p>We should work to extend this campaign to the entire country. Federal funds should be
            made available for such operations when needed. It would be the best 
       &#8593;National&#8595;
    
            investment. It would be a better use of tax payers&#8217; money to pension the sterilized
            couple rather than paying a dole to increase the size of the family as it is being done
            in various countries. &#8220;Our babies are dying, give us more babies,&#8221; is
            the illogical cry of the dark ages.</p>
        <p>Again I want to say I regret not being with you today, but let&#8217;s say better luck next
            time.</p>
