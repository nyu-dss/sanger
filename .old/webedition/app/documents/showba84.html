        <h1>The Civilizing Force of Birth Control</h1>
        <h3>by MARGARET SANGER</h3>
        <p>Instead of mobilizing a vast and dazzling array of what our politicians like to refer to
            as "facts 'n figgers" in a vain effort to present birth control as the wholesale panacea
            of all the sufferings of humanity (to be effective at some vague date in the future), I
            shall here attempt nothing more than to show that the practice of contraception to-day,
            among ever-increasing numbers of parents and parents-to-be, is an active and
            contributing factor to that something we call civilization--an active and contributing
            factor, please not, and not a mere passive accompaniment of progress. In other words, I
            hope to show that birth control is a cause, not a mere effect. But at the outset it is
            necessary, I think, to clarify our meaning of that much used word "civilization."</p>
        <p>Just what do we mean by civilization? It has been variously defined. It means, according
            to Montesquieu, "to render an intelligent being yet more
                intelligent." According to the theologians, it means "to make
                reason and the will of God prevail." Out of the various definitions that have
            come to us from the thinkers of the past, it becomes clear that civilization cannot be
            an affair of the individual alone. We come to see that civilization is the creation not
            of a single generation but of many; that it is the general substitution of order for
            disorder; of security in living instead of chaos. Civilization means the development of
            social and benevolent traits instead of the anti-social, the destructive, and the
            criminal instincts. It wakens men and women to the realization that they are all members
            of one great organism, so that it is impossible for one member of society, or one class
            of society, to be indifferent to the rest, or to realize inherent potentialities
            independent of the rest. The individual who insists upon the enjoyment of his own
            selfish pleasure, irrespective of the consequences of this indulgence to the present
            generation or the next, is obviously acting in an irresponsible and anti-social, and
            therefore an <span class="italics">uncivilized</span> manner. He is reverting to
            barbarism and brutality. The civilized individual, on the other hand, realizes that he
            must share with the less fortunate the fruits of his own education, and that when he is
            doing all he can to enlarge and increase the volume of the human stream seeking
            enlightenment he increases thereby his own enjoyment of life. </p>
        <p>Perhaps we can do no better than to accept Matthew
                Arnold's concept of a civilized society: "when the best
                available knowledge is distributed among them, when they are animated by a passion
                for the harmonious perfection of their faculties, when they have a true sense of
                human values, when their social sympathy is quick." The capital need of
            civilization, he tells us in his <span class="italics">master thought</span>, is that the
            whole body of society should come to live with a life worthy to be called <span class="italics">human</span> and corresponding with man's true aspiration and powers.
                "This, the humanization of man in society, is civilization. The aim
                for us all is to promote it, and to promote it is above all the aim of the true
                politician."</p>
        <p>Civilization, then, implies the development and the actual realization of the inherent
            potentialities of the individual and the race. An environment--physical or social--which
            destroys, warps, or wastes these innate promises cannot in all fairness be characterized
            as civilized. This is how we must interpret the expression "human perfection," upon
            which thinkers of the past placed such importance.</p>
        <p>Before proceeding to our attempt to show how dynamically the principle of birth control
            is related to these fundamental elements which constitute true civilization, it may be
            here profitable to summarize those factors. Our brief survey indicates that civilization
            advances by (1) the increase of intelligence (Montesquieu); (2) the replacing of
            disorder by order; (3) the substitution of philanthropic motives for anti-social and
            purely selfish activities; (4) the dissemination of the best available knowledge; (5) a
            passion for the harmonious perfection of human faculties; and (6) aiming to make
            possible for the whole body of society a life worthy to be called <span class="italics">human</span> (Arnold).</p>
        <p>The program for universal birth control aims at the attainment, by the most direct and
            least hypocritical of methods, of the conditions enumerated above. It wastes neither
            time nor effort upon any fragmentary solution of the secondary problems of human
            society; but it insists that no solution of the complex problems of education, of social
            relations, of economic, industrial and political disorder, can be solved as long as the
            fundamental problem of human breeding is ignored. The birth control program is not
            concerned with the fruits of culture, but with sowing the "seeds" of civilization. It
            does not insist that men and women be educated by books or the arts; but upon the basis
            of their innate, though possibly, undeveloped, intelligence, it does seek to awaken them
            to a consciousness of their responsibilities toward each other, to their children and
            children-to-be, and thus to the community of the present and of the future. Thus it
            seeks to fulfill the requirement expressed by Montesquieu: it renders intelligent beings
            yet more intelligent! We have discovered that initial intelligence--so wisely implied by
            the French sage yet so commonly overlooked--in the mothers of the most poverty-stricken
            strata of society--a rudimentary type of intelligence, if you will, but nevertheless
            capable of growth and development if nourished and cultivated in a sympathetic and
            civilized way--by sympathy, by answering the questions nearest the poor mother's heart,
            be meeting her needs, by divesting the technique of contraception of its harsh,
            professional and incomprehensible verbiage so that it becomes an everyday matter in her
            life.</p>
        <p>After you have worked year in and year out among these mothers of the so-called lower
            classes, after you have witnesses the gradual change in their mental states, from fear
            and dejection and hopelessness to increasing assurancy and self-reliance, to confidence
            and mastery of life, you cannot avoid the realization that the very success of the
            practice--the concrete demonstration that intelligent control carries with it its own
            reward--brings with it psychic benefits of incalculable value. The mother no longer
            considers herself a slave. She is glad that she is standing upon her own feet. She feels
            herself mistress of her own life, and no longer the inert, helpless, hopeless victim of
            circumstances which inevitably go from bad to worse. The difference is as striking as
            that between freeman and slave. The mothers who are liberated--and liberated through the
            exercise of their own intelligence and foresight--from the relentless pressure of
            involuntary motherhood--almost automatically become more interested in life, in the
            future, in the upbringing of their children, in the affairs of the community at large.
            In a word, they have become more <span class="italics">civilized</span>. And this has
            been made possible not through the much-vaulted agencies of popular education, but
            because she has been given simple, sanitary instruction which assures her mastery of her
            own body and procreative functions. I could present the testimony of many parents--and
            particularly mothers--who have thus been enabled to regain mastery over the conditions
            of their lives and are consequently fulfilling their maternal functions in far happier
            and more efficient fashion.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, I have received thousands upon thousands of appeals from women who
            have had maternity thrust upon the time after time in rapid succession. To such women
            life holds little or no hope. Their interests are restricted to the miseries which
            engulf them and their ever-growing families.</p>
        <p>To how great an extent this mastery is due to the instrument of birth control is made
            evident by a consideration of the painful confessions of women still in the bondage of
            enforced maternity. I have received thousands of these; and an analysis of them
            indicates the almost inevitable development of a particular <span class="italics">psychosis</span> or abnormal mental state. A rapid succession of pregnancies is
            usually productive of a mental condition verging on melancholia, the outgrowth of fear
            and the sense of unwarranted defeat in life. The slave mother comes to consider herself
            as a special, an exceptional victim of circumstances over which she has no control. Her
            interests are contracted to her own little sphere. In some cases, the miserable
            poverty-stricken home, the array of unwelcome children, the irresponsible, selfish, and
            often shiftless, husband, all become associated in her mind as outward evidence of her
            long series of sufferings; and she turns from them, drawing more and more into herself,
            and evading the responsibilities she cannot bring herself to face. </p>
        <p>Such mothers, and the unfortunate children brought up in the environment they create, are
            scarcely encouraging subjects for the dissemination of culture or civilization. They
            may, and indeed do, become the passive recipients of what currently passes for popular
            education. <span class="italics">But true education is attained, only when men, women and
                children are made to see and to realize the tangible consequences of their own
                efforts.</span></p>
        <p>Bitter experience teaches the slave mother that unwanted babies are almost invariably the
            penalty inflicted upon her for her participation in a few brief ecstatic moments of
            physical indulgence, the pleasures of which sometimes she does not even share. After a
            rapid series of undesired pregnancies, the intimacies of the marital relation strike
            terror into the heart of the wife; her response to the advances of her husband has been
            "conditioned" by the heavy penalty which has been exacted. And so even the happiness of
            marriage is denied. Normal mental reactions are replaced by the psychic patterns and the
            mechanisms of despair and defeat. She comes to feel that she is the helpless victim of
            blind, relentless forces that have no respect for the dignity of the individual, as
            indeed she is. It is one of the ineradicable traits of the human mind to expect some
            eventual reward for sacrifice and effort--and when these rewards are withheld, one of
            the strongest motives for sustained courage in the face of apparently insurmountable
            obstacles has been removed.</p>
        <p>Equipped with the instrument of birth control, the mother regains not only mastery of her
            procreative function, but an immeasurably increased sense of power over life itself.
            Thus quite aside from its economic and eugenic aspects--the importance of which I am in
            no sense seeking to minimize--the practice of birth control brings with it inestimable
            physical benefits. A whole sphere of life--the sexual--is elevated from the level of the
            purely instinctive and fortuitous and submitted to intelligent direction. Mystery and
            ignorance are banished. Married love is enriched and greatly reinforced by completely
            fulfilled sexual communion which has been emancipated of the destructive restrictions
            and mutilations of unexpressed fears. And so between husband and wife mental and
            spiritual bonds are strengthened and vitalized. </p>
        <p>I dwell thus upon what we may term the psychic <span class="italics">by-products</span> of
            the practice of birth control because it is undoubtedly by them that we can most
            immediately gauge it as an <span class="italics">active</span> and <span class="italics">contributing</span> factor of civilization. The practice of birth control tends to
            break up old habits and old prejudices concerning the marital relation. There is no
            denying this fact. Birth control is not consistent with the whispered furtiveness, the
            secrecy, the ashamed and hurried contact, consummated under cover of darkness; the
            passive submission of the virtuous wife to the imperious demands of an insatiate spouse;
            nor with the gradual degradation of the sexual act into a mere physiological function,
            which, in the words of Shakespeare--<br>"...within a dull, stale, tired bed,<br>Goes to the
                creating of a whole tribe of fops,<br>Got 'twixt sleep and wake..."</p>
        <p>Just as civilized gastronomy has elevated the crude act of eating into an art of esthetic
            refinement, so the program of birth control aims to substitute for the greedy, hurried
            consummation of physical passion a reverent ritual undertaken with adequate preparation
            and under conditions which contribute to its beauty and assure its satisfying
            completion. The hungry man on the verge of starvation ravenously satisfies the cravings
            of his physical needs. The civilized man dines slowly, savoring to the full the flavors
            of the exquisitely prepared food before him, sublimating thus a physical need into an
            art of appreciation, even perhaps to the extent of educating himself in the essential
            wholesomeness of those commonplace acts out of which, on the whole, life is made up. So
            in the realm of sex we may bolt our pleasure, greedily satisfy deep-seated physiological
            and psychic cravings, selfishly usurp as much of crude sexual pleasure as we can, and
            always with reckless indifference to the consequences of our selfish acts, and with a
            total irresponsibility to its penalties. But such selfishness reveals none of the
            attributes of civilization, and carries with it its own penalty: for he who is selfish
            in the love-relation can never experience its deepest joys.</p>
        <p>The technique of birth control disassociates two ideas: the ritual of physical and
            spiritual communion and the process of reproduction. Its opponents say that its
            advocates overvalue the former and undervalue the latter. They fail to recognize that,
            by placing the implement of this disassociation into the hands of husbands and wives, it
            places with them the responsibility of using that implement with intelligence and
            discrimination. But such has ever, since the discovery of fire, been the serene,
            untroubled way of civilization. It has placed in men's hands the sharp-edged knife, the
            razor, the harnessed powers of steam and electricity, alcohol, gunpowder, firearms,
            radioactivity and now the power of flight. Do not tell us that he will abuse these
            powers, that he will misuse them to his own destruction. We know that already. He has;
            he does; he will. But out of his own experience, his own trial and error, his own
            mistakes, by suffering his own self-inflicted punishments and his own hard-earned
            rewards, man slowly but certainly advances on the path of civilization. Like every other
            great instrument of civilization, birth control is making men and women face a new
            responsibility, and forcing their intelligence to the solution of problems they had for
            ages deliberately avoided.</p>
        <p>Because of its misuse and abuse by reactionaries and defenders of the <span class="italics">status quo</span>, the term "morality" has come to connote, in this
            twentieth century of ours, practically everything that is distasteful to the spirit of
            progress. As a matter of fact, however, we cannot evade the problem of morality; and
            such ideas as may be advanced as instruments of an emergent civilization must be tested
            form the point of view of ethical integrity. Birth control has been denounced as
            inimical to the mind and morals and health of the younger citizens to whom we look for
            the future growth and upbuilding of civilization. Its opponents claim that it will
            permit the "dissemination of immoral and salacious literature under the guise of
            information, and will give unlimited opportunity to the purveyors of the obscene in
            newspaper, magazine and every other form of advertising." Marriage without the desire
            and responsibility of parenthood, and not lived in strict continence, is "immoral and
            sinful." The authority on which this opposition of the Roman Catholic Church
            against birth control is based is the conception that there is only one true Church, and
            subsequently only one true morality. It is claimed that the Catholic Church is the
            depository of eternal truth, the Kingdom of God on earth. The
            Catholic Church, according to Father Ward, is
            therefore responsible for the morals of the entire human race. It is the duty of the
            Church, therefore, to interfere with and to block all legislation that may adversely
            affect the "morals" of non-Catholics as well as Catholics. Though we have been led
            astray by ethical error, we are still all her children. The Catholic Church never loses
            the hope that non-Catholics will some day be counted into the fold. The Church therefore
            considers it her duty to supervise all social and moral legislation.</p>
        <p>The position of the Church, as enunciated by this executive of the National Catholic
                Welfare Conference, exemplifies by its very exaggeration the concept of a
            "closed system" of morality that is far more prevalent than might at first be suspected.
            From this point of view there no longer exists any living moral problem. Right and wrong
            in the realm of ethical action have been decided once and for all time. No choice is
            offered the individual. He may submit to the dictates of the higher authority, and be
            saved; or he may decide his own problems for himself, and be eternally damned. He cannot
            question the laws of the ecclesiastical authorities concerning his sexual behavior.
            He--or preferably, she--is offered the choice between uninterrupted procreation or rigid
            continence. Unquestioning obedience, submission to ecclesiastical law, and the reference
            of all intimate personal and sexual problems to the nearest representative of the
            Church--such are the ready-made solutions to all moral questions of the adherents of
            this type of ethics.</p>
        <p>This Catholic system of morality is the archetype of all ethical systems which rest upon
            unquestioning obedience of higher authorities, and which instill absolute respect for
            the folkways of the tribe. Morality of this type is responsible to no slight degree for
            the age-old opposition of the medical profession to the practice of contraception.
            Conformity, respect for all external laws, and a blind and bland indifference to
            anything except the preordained and predetermined "plan of God" as formulated by the
            accented authorities, are the essential virtues accentuated by all such closed systems
            of morality.</p>
        <p>Against such "morality," the spirit of Western Civilization is revolting with
            ever-increasing vigor. There has been a revolution in the world of morality of which we
            are now beginning to taste the first fruits. We are no longer living in a little closed
            completed universe of which God's plan was revealed once and for all time to a little
            group of delegates. The center of our universe has shifted from Heaven to earth. There
            have been at least four centuries of criticism and skepticism concerning the nature of
            "morals." Science and philosophy have destroyed the old concept of the absolute. All
            conditions that determine behavior and individual conduct are being remined. This new
            world, this emergent civilization, is one of experimentation, of trial and error. The
            revealed and dogmatic basis of morality, as expressed by the Roman Catholics, and as
            accepted by so many other unthinking religious organizations, by so many so-called
            educators, by so many limited members of the medical profession, and even by some who
            call themselves sociologists, has lost its old authority.</p>
        <p>Where the dogmatists read black, the world to-day is reading white. What they consider
            "morality" we consider moral imbecility. To-day we are claiming the right to solve our
            own problems, to make our own mistake and to learn the inevitable lesson to be derived
            from such mistakes. Our morality is an "ethics of the dust," as
            Professor Edwin Holt has expressed it, a morality of
            reality, aiming to show men and women the structure of their relationships to each
            other, to the world at large, and the world to be. It is not a morality concerned with
            melodramatic rewards and punishments, with absolute rights and wrongs, with unhealthy
            lingering interests in virginity and chastity, with its propensity for prying into the
            unwholesome details of sexual behavior, but a morality insisting that men and women
            shall face honestly and realistically the intimate problems of their own lives, and that
            they themselves, on the bases of their own experience and own desires, solve those
            problems with the instruments of intelligence, insight and honesty.</p>
        <p>Birth control places in their hands a delicate instruments calling for intelligence and
            foresight for its successful use. And such an instrument, calling as it does for a
            greater mastery of the art of life, becomes ipso
                facto a power for the development of the new morality.</p>
        <p>Civilization, as we suggested in our introduction, is not concerned merely with the
            individual. It is a communal achievement. Its perpetuation depends upon its incessant
            expansion--its fecundity in quickening the spirit of each generation. It thrives by the
            diffusion of the <span class="italics">best available knowledge</span>. The carriers of
            civilization are the scientists, the philosophers, the artists; and also all those men
            and women who labor to divest knowledge of its secret, hidden, exclusive aspects, who
            humanize it, who make it understood outside the cliques of the cultivated and
            sophisticated, yet who in so doing do not corrupt it with falsehood. It is the supreme
            duty of the civilized, then, to disseminate as widely as possible the benefits of
            knowledge. Not without significance is the fact that we associate the very word
            civilization most closely with those institutions which monopolize or pervert the truth
            for private gain. Such exclusiveness and selfishness, either in an individual or an
            institution, present grave obstacles to that humanization of knowledge upon which the
            very existence and perpetuation of culture depends.</p>
        <p>The question to decide, in this connection, is whether the knowledge of birth control is
            worthy to be disseminated by the great distributors of <span class="italics">the best
                available knowledge</span>. We know that it has been condemned as a practice by the
            Church, that punitive statutes have been legislated aiming to circumvent its diffusion
            amongst the people at large. I do not intend here to attempt to refute the many
            arguments that have been advanced against the practice of birth control. For the most
            part they are based on the grounds of its "unnaturalness" and its alleged immorality.
            Against these claims, despite the condemnation of the spokesmen of traditional theology,
            despite all restrictive legislation, the practice of birth control has been accepted by
            ever increasing numbers of intelligent and prudent people in all civilized
            countries--mainly among the middle and upper classes. There is no dearth of statistics
            and carefully verified data to demonstrate that the practice of contraception is
            invariably correlated with intelligence, foresight and a higher standard of living among
            the parents; that a comparatively low birth-rate is accompanied by a correspondingly low
            infantile mortality rate and a low maternal mortality rate. On the other hand, a high
            birth-rate, in all countries of the world, is accompanied by a high infant mortality
            rate, a low standard of living, and chaotic and often disastrous social and political
            conditions. As we descend the social scale, as the ordinary standard of intelligent
            living decreases, the birth-rate increases and the prudential check of birth control is
            ignored.</p>
        <p>Birth control is thus no mere tentative theory, uncertain and untired, but an actual
            practice, tested and efficacious among the majority of intelligent husbands and wives.
            (In passing it is interesting to note that I have the records of not a few mothers of
            large and healthy families who admit their indebtedness to the practice of birth
            control. Such women, of the maternal type, and in comfortable economic circumstances,
            have desired more children than the normal woman, but have adopted the practices of
            birth control, in order to "space" the advent of each new arrival, and to exercize a
            complete control over their health and that of the family, without sacrificing the
            normal and legitimate happiness of the marriage relation.)</p>
        <p>Why then has the diffusion of this important discovery been so retarded among those who
            need it most? The reason is not remote: Modern civilization has been lamentably
            neglectful of the central and fundamental importance of the whole problem of sex and
            human breeding. Occidental folkways have been based upon an outgrown medieval theology
            which even day-to-day exerts an incalculably dysgenic influence upon the race. Yet
            gropingly and with such means as they could devise, all societies have sought to insure
            and to perpetuate the well-being of the race and to prevent its degeneration. The high
            value placed upon <span class="italics">good breeding</span>, the condemnations of <span class="italics">alliances</span> (no matter how unwarranted they may have been in
            particular instances) have been tentative precautionary measures toward racial health
            and development.</p>
        <p>Scientific methods of contraception seem therefore to have come as an answer to a great
            universal demand, which for centuries had been groping in the dark toward articulate
            expression. It is almost inconceivable that scarcely a century has passed since men
            first came to a realization that the great natural force of sexual passion--co-equal in
            its importance with hunger--might and should be harnessed for the needs and the benefit
            of civilization. Even then, this discovery seems to have been hit upon only
            accidentally, as an adjunct to investigations into problems of political economy.
                Malthus advocated continence and small
            families as a preventative of threatening overpopulation. And it was not for several
            decades that conception was advocated for the same reason. To-day we realize that
            irrespective of its relation to the questions of overpopulation and the disposal of
            surplus populations by emigration or the conquest of new territories, the practice of
            hygienic contraception needs an external justification--<span class="italics">it is a
                civilizing force in itself</span>, and carried with it its own immediate benefits,
            its own rewards to the parents, to the children, and to the community at large.</p>
        <p>Education in birth control does not restrict itself to the impersonal prescription of a
            device or a method, but aims to establish a new and sounder foundation for all marriage
            and all parenthood. The leaders of this program have not remained satisfied with
            imperfect contraceptives witch interfere with or restrict the physical completion of
            sexual communion in marriage. The history of marriage and its tragedies have awakened
            them to the dangers of thwarting or restricting that relationship. And so the exponents
            of birth control have called upon scientists for the perfection of methods, for a
            contraceptive that shall in no way interrupt the complex, continuous act of sexual
            communion, but which shall, in particular, make possible the release of the psychic
            tension, no longer inhibited by the fear of pregnancy. As an English authority on the
            subject has wisely written: "In no stage should there be awareness of the
                contraceptive, except in so far as there is awareness that the particular act of
                sexual intercourse is one that will not be followed by pregnancy."</p>
        <p>Instead of operating as a menace to the foundations of marriage, birth control is
            actually one of the surest means of assuring the fulfillment of its inherent promises.
            It recreates the very pattern of the marriage relation, perforce substituting
            intelligence and common sense for shame and the half-guilty consciousness of sin; of
            consideration for brutal selfishness; and of foresight for reckless irresponsibility. In
            all of these prevision is unquestionably a force working with and not contrary to the
            spirit of civilization as we understand it.</p>
        <p>Its greatest value, however, is to be found in its assertion--and not its denial, as its
            enemies claim--of the supreme importance of child-life. One inconvertible fact we cannot
            escape: among families into which a large number of children are born, there is apt to
            be a correspondingly large infantile morality. The unwelcome child has an appreciably
            smaller chance of survival than the child brought into the world by desire. The grossly
            sentimental notion that the mother of many children is the best mother is still
            prevailing, despite the most overwhelming evidence to the contrary. I have briefly
            sketched the ordinary self-confessed mental condition of the ordinary mother of
            unwelcome children. That the obstacles such children must overcome in their unequal
            struggle for life can contribute to their development is another fallacy that must be
            punctured once and for all. Life presents obstacles enough to all of us--they need not
            be multiplied in the heart of the family for the benefit of young children! The mental
            and physical condition of the mother, both before and after birth, is of paramount
            importance to the whole life of her child. Whether we be partisans of hereditary or of
            environment as the chief factor in the life of an individual, there can be no denying
            this factor--since the mother is both environment and heredity. Now that we realize that
            the first five years of a life are the most plastic and are those in which the whole
            psychic pattern of maturity is set, the importance of the surrounding and enveloping
            motherhood can scarcely be overestimated.</p>
        <p>I have sought merely to trace the manifold implications and potentialities of birth
            control as a civilizing force. I have purposely avoided its less intimate and less
            actual aspects, hoping to emphasize the necessity of dissemination to the less fortunate
            classes by those who to-day enjoy its advantages. The civilized human being is commanded
            to carry others along with him in his march toward self-realization and perfection, or
            to be stunted and enfeebled in his own development if he disobeys. He can fulfill this
            duty best by sharing with others the knowledge which has aided him and his own family to
            maintain a standard of living which permits participation and enjoyments of the higher
            gifts of life. We need not be discouraged if obstacles are placed in our path. For we
            know that everywhere suppliant arms are outstretched to receive our message, and that
            the exercise of intelligence begets intelligence in kind. Only to the disdainful and
            contemptuous, from the heights of their embattled selfishness, does this human soil into
            which we are seeking to implant the seeds of intelligent mastery of instinct, appear
            barren or sterile. We who have trod it know that it is capable, despite its seeming
            rockiness and its harsh surface, of nourishing these seeds, and of bringing them in
            their time to honorable fruition.</p>
        <p>In allying ourselves with this force, we are sharing in that great communal parenthood
            that is far more fundamental than the selfish, egocentric parenthood which despite its
            endless activity and its incessant proliferation, remains infinitely insignificant as a
            contributive source to true civilization. In teaching birth control, we are the active
            agents of true civilization.</p>
        <p>The changing attitude toward contraception, which is evident everywhere when men and
            women are thinking deeply about the constant problems of human existence--in
                Europe, in Asia, and in America--is one of the eloquent indices of the triumph of the new,
            scientific morality. It indicates the laying of a solid foundation for the civilization
            of the future. This, I venture to prophesy, will differ from the so-called civilization
            of the East, which has erected its structure on the ugly basis of human slavery and
            misery. It will be a civilization of a healthy and happy worldliness, demanding no blood
            sacrifices and permitting to each individual the full realization of his innate
            potentialities. We shall reach spiritual communism through the blossoming of the self. </p>
        <p>Women in the past have been confronted with the empty victories of political freedom, of
            economic freedom, of social freedom. But with the winning of <span class="italics">biological freedom</span>, women and men and children will enter triumphantly into
            an era that will be in every sense of the word civilized. </p>
        <p>In this hurried survey, I have purposely refrained from touching upon specific aspects of
            the present situation concerning birth control policies in the various countries of the
            world. I have sought instead to empathize civilization's need for this instrument to
            effect humanity's liberation from the destructive slave-morality promulgated for so many
            centuries past. Until this is scrapped, no civilization worthy of the name can
            emerge.</p>
