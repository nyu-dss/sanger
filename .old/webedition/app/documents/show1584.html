        <h1>NO MASTERS</h1>
        <p>The main cause of the social misery endured by the working women to-day lies not so much
            in the value of wages received as in the way they have to be earned. It is not alone the
            work done, but the bullying, the hustling and the submission which the wage system
            entails, that blights the life of the worker and creates a just hatred of the master
            class. And there can be no hope for the woman worker until she realizes the degradation
            of "work" and the injustice of a system which forces her, in order
            to obtain the barest necessities of life, to be snubbed and insulted and driven by a
            master.</p>
        <p>Powerful as the master class is depicted to be, owing to the apparent acquiescence and
            ignorance of its victims, it is inherently in a weak and dangerous position. For its
            very life it now depends upon the divisions and delusions which from time to time sway
            the working class. And these divisions and delusions are fostered and maintained by paid
            writers, scientists and politicians, aided by a venal press.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most popular and enervating idea accepted by the majority of workers to-day,
            is the doctrine of economic evolution, a doctrine which was formulated by the
                'sociologists' and which asserts that the capitalist system of
            production for profit cannot be broken by any conscious effort on the part of the
            workers; that we must have masters and recognize the authority of masters until the dawn
            of some 'ism. The one thing the sociologists like to talk about is
                "Evolution", i.e. expansion and development. Since the advent
            of Malthus, Darwin, and Karl Marx this doctrine of evolution with its
                "survival of the fittest", "struggle for
                existence" and "self-preservation" laws, has sapped the
            vitality of the formidable working class movement which arose in the 19th century and
            which for more than a generation has sent successive shivers through the fabric of the
            capitalist system. Karl Marx it was who popularized the contemptible notion that this
            system must endure until all capital has been concentrated into a few hands in the form
            of one big trust and that the workers must wait until they themselves had formed one
            world-wide party before they would be in a position to take over the accumulated capital
            and work for themselves instead of for an idle class.</p>
        <p>The evolutionist, like the madman, is in a prison--the prison of one idea. These people
            seem to think it singularly surprising if the worker suddenly flings to the wind all
            social theories and raises the banner "No Masters". The system must go
            on, they say. The time is not yet "ripe" for a change. The
                "machinery of government" and the "machinery of
                production" must be captured and so on. Nothing is really interesting to
            them, such as direct action, sabotage, the removal of a tyrant or the sudden taking over
            of a mine or a factory or of a farm. To tell the workers that they must wait for the
            accumulation of capital and for the "economic development" of the
            capitalist regime is like telling a prisoner in the penitentiary that he would be glad
            to hear that the jail now covers the state of New
            York. The jailer would have nothing to show the prisoner except more and more
            long corridors of stone lit by ghastly lights and empty of all that is human. So these
            expanders and evolutionists have nothing to show us except more and more infinite
            multitudes of wage slaves empty of all individuality, courage, idealism, humanity and
            spirit, and hopelessly submissive to the demigods of Capital.</p>
        <p>No one doubts that the ordinary working woman can get on with the capitalist system as it
            is--at a price. The demand of the class-conscious worker, however, is not strength
            enough to get along with it, but to destroy it. Can woman hate enough to do this and yet
            love her class enough to think it worth emancipating? Can she look upon the colossal
            good, the hardihood and the endurance of the wage slaves without feeling sympathy? Can
            she look upon the colossal evil of wage slavery without once feeling despair? Can she be
            a rebel woman? Can she be a fanatic? Is she prepared to sacrifice the whole race for the
            sake of itself?</p>
        <p>The masters argue that because we cannot have equality in a silk factory we cannot have
            it anywhere. Because we cannot have good-fellowship in business we cannot have it at
            all. They argue that society cannot do without "labor", meaning
            servitude -- without the bossing and the firing and the too old at forty and all the
            rest of their filth. If society cannot do without masters and wage slaves, so much the
            worse for society. For we are prepared to sacrifice our machines, our wheels and tunnels
            and wires and systems and slave lives for one hour of happiness.</p>
        <p>Do not be led astray by the towering materialism which dominates the mind of the wage
            earners to-day which rests upon the false assumption that because a few generations go
            on doing the same thing over and over again, we all live in a system of clockwork
            evolution. Do not let fear prevent you from leading a free life. Live up to your own
            ideal and to the standard inscribed on the banner of the WOMAN REBEL--No
            Gods, No Masters.</p>
