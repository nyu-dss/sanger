        <h1>Mrs. Sanger Explains Where Most Chicago Babies Come From</h1>
        What makes Chicago grow? Where do thebabies
                come from? From what districts do the increase of business customers, the increase
                of population, that cause rising land values, come from?
            Margaret Sanger, birth control advocate
                answers. She says working class women, pro rata, woman for woman, breed and bring to
                the daylight of Chicago three times as many babies as the women of the rich and
                well-to-do class.
        <p>"I am getting the figures on Chicago," said Mrs. Sanger to a Day Book reporter at Congress Hotel today.
            "And I am sure that the showing in Chicago will be much the same as that of Paris and of Berlin.</p>
        <p>"The women on the fashionable Lake Shore drive have the money to pay physicians to tell
            the growing daughters, young married women, how to take care of themselves. They know
            how to stop babies from coming when babies are not wanted. Skilled physicians give these
            women this knowledge on how to stop the babies from coming."</p>
        <p>"In the stockyards district, or any other swarming working class district, babies and
            babies come and these babies are not welcome. They arrive because the mothers don't have
            the same knowledge as the women on the Lake Shore drive."</p>
        <p>"A survey in Paris showed 32 births per 1,000 among women in a residential district of
            rich. In a poor working class district, a typical one, the birth rate was 116 per
            1,000."</p>
        <p>"In Berlin the rate was 47 per 1,000 among the well-to-do women and 157 per 1,000 among
            the poor."</p>
        
            Mrs. Sanger lectures Sunday night in Little
                    theater, Fine Arts bldg. Her
                secretary, Fania Mindell, said today that all
                seats have been sold, with more calls coming, and the lecture may be given in
                Assembly hall, Fine Arts bldg. Several hundred were turned away Tuesday night in
                    Workers' Institute.
            The big main proposition she stands for is that working class women should have the
                same information about birth control, regulation of the number of children to a
                family, that rich women have.
            The Sanger woman was a trained nurse 14 years in obstetric cases and personally
                served mothers in several thousand births. She is herself the mother of two superb
                children, and has won her way against terrific opposition by force of an unusual
                personality.
        <p>"Of course, it is not pleasant for some girls to face the facts of birth control," she
            said. "But I would urge upon any wife of an underpaid 
        [<em>man chance?</em>]
    
            that it is far more unpleasant for her to find herself burdened down with half a dozen
            children she never wished for, helpless, starved, shoddily clothed children dragging at
            her skirts and she only a dragged-out shadow of the woman she once was."</p>
        <p>"Women of the working class, especially wage workers, should not have more than two
            children at the most. The average workingman can support no more and the average working
            woman can take care of no more in decent fashion."</p>
        <p>"It has been my experience that more children are not really wanted, but that the women
            are compelled to have them either from lack of foresight or through ignorance of the
            hygiene of preventing conception."</p>
        <p>"It is only the workers who are ignorant of the knowledge of how to prevent bringing
            children into the world to fill the hospitals and jails, factories and mills, insane
            asylums and premature graves."</p>
        <p>"The working class can use direct action by refusing to supply the labor market with
            children to be exploited, by refusing to populate the earth with slaves."</p>
