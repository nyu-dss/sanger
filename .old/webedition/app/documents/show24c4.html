		<h1>A NEWS LETTER FROM MARGARET SANGER</h1>
		<p> My recent experiences, while on a speaking tour, have shown me the extent to which the
				Roman Catholic Church dictates the policy of the municipal authorities in
			many of our cities. I was scheduled to speak in Albany,
			March 6th, at the Jewish Community
				Center. A week before the lecture, several Catholic officials tried to bring
			pressure to bear through the Albany social agencies to get the Jewish Community Center
			to rescind their invitation. Fortunately, the Auditorium belonged to the Jewish group
			and the Mayor was unable to revoke the
			license.</p>
		<p>The same forces tried to break up the meeting at New
				Haven on March 8th. I was scheduled to speak at the Troup Junior High
				School under the auspices of the Young Men&#8217;s and Young Women&#8217;s Hebrew
					Association. Following a protest by the Reverend Joseph Mereto of Chicago, a missionary conducting a Lenten mission at St. Anthony&#8217;s
				Roman Catholic Church, the permit for the use of the Auditorium was revoked at
			noon on Saturday. An informal protest committee was hastily formed headed by Dr. A. N. Creadick, president of the
					Connecticut Birth Control League. Among the many
			distinguished citizens who rallied to my support were Dean Milton C. Winternitz, of the Yale Medical School; Dr. Herbert Thomas, associate professor obstetrics and
			gynecology at the Yale Medical School; Attorney Charles E. Watrous, Professor James
				Wayne Cooper of the Yale Law
				School; Dr. James R. Miller of Hartford; Jacob
				Merviss, executive director of the Y. M. and Y. W. H. A., and C. P. Ives, 2nd, associate editor of the New Haven Journal-Courier.</p>
		<p>A large delegation called at the Mayor&#8217;s office early
			Monday morning to demand a license for the meeting. This was finally granted for the
				Fox College theater. In view of the widespread indignation, the
			opposition did not dare push the matter further. According to the newspaper reports,
			2000 people were present at the meeting.</p>
		<p>In Boston I addressed a group of medical students, under
			the auspices of the Lancet Club. The majority of those present were third
			year students; several had graduated and were doing internship, but my address was the
			first information on contraception that they had received.</p>
		<p>On my West Virginia trip, it was again a story of Catholic opposition
			bringing pressure to bear. The result was that the Cabell County Medical
				Society of Huntington rescinded their
			invitation to me. However, thanks to the courage and fine spirit of Dr. James S. Klumpp, Dr. William Strange and others, I was asked to speak under the auspices of an
			independent group of twenty physicians, and the meeting was held at the Pritchard
				Hotel and was open to the public. Fully 1000 people attended and approximately
			400 were turned away. I have great hopes that the interest aroused may shortly result in
			the establishment of a clinic.</p>
		<p>I also spoke to several mining groups in West Virginia and found there conditions that
			would horrify us were we living in a foreign land. The women were most interested and
			very intelligent. The men were more silent and opinion seemed somewhat divided among
			them. As a result of these meetings, however, another meeting was arranged the following
			week by the Catholic group to offset, no doubt, the favorable reaction toward birth
			control that a proper presentation of the subject arouses.</p>
		
			<h1>CONNECTICUT</h1>
			<p>The Hartford Federation of Churches went on record at its annual meeting
				on February 23rd in favor of the dissemination of information about birth control to
				those who desire it. The following resolutions were adopted, as recommended by Dr.
					James R. Miller, chairman of the
				Federation&#8217;s committee on social welfare, which had been requested to make a study
				of birth control:</p>
			<p>
				Birth control is merely one phase of the eugenic problem. Protestant
					faiths claim not only the right but a duty for mankind to exercise intelligent
					supervision over this problem. Sexual relations should be regarded as entirely
					natural, and sinful only as they are abused.
			</p>
			<p>
				In our land, where free speech and free education have been made the
					foundation of our democracy, it is peculiarly false teaching that anyone should
					be denied by statute, access to any information which he may desire.
			</p>
		
		
			<h1>
				NEW JERSEY
			</h1>
			<p>Mrs. F. Robertson Jones, president of
				the American Birth Control League, debated with Albert J. Shea, Hoboken attorney, on Is Birth Control a Benefit
					to Humanity? before the Forum of the American Legion of Secaucus. A record attendance of over 500 followed the
				argument with interest and asked numerous questions. No vote was taken.</p>
		
		
			<h1>
				NEW YORK
			</h1>
			<p>A comprehensive survey of Methodism in Manhattan,
				the Bronx and Westchester County has recently been published by the Methodist
					Episcopal Church City Planning Committee, and includes the results of a
				questionnaire on birth control. 740 laymen against 138 voted that they agreed with
				the action taken by the New York East
					Conference of the church in passing a resolution that &#8220;the
					law preventing doctors from furnishing birth control information should be
					changed.&#8221;</p>
		
		
			<h1>
				PENNSYLVANIA
			</h1>
			<p>A Marriage Council service has been initiated by Mrs. Stuart Mudd at 1831 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia. It is offered &#8220;to
					help young married couples, or those contemplating marriage, to a better
					understanding of common requisites for a happy and healthy companionship in
					married life--to help them avoid some of the causes of marital
				difficulties.&#8221; Among the distinguished sponsors are Dr. Frederick H. Allen, director,
					Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic, Dr. Lovett Dewees, attending physicians, Bryn Mawr Hospital and
				president of the Pennsylvania Birth Control Federation, Rabbi William H. Fineshriber, Keneseth
					Israel Synagogue, Mrs. Philip Kind,
				vice president, Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom,
					Mrs. George Bacon Wood, member of the
				Board of Directors, Y.
					W. C. A.
