        <h1>STERILIZATION</h1>
        <h2>(A Modern Medical Program for Health and Human Welfare)</h2>
        <h3>By Margaret Sanger</h3>
        <p>It happened in an American city. A blind couple were the object of much sympathy, some
            little charity and a great deal of relief. They had six children, all born blind, and
            the community commiserated as Americans always do with profound misfortune. The idea
            that six young lives had been born into the world doomed never to see sunlight or trees
            or other human beings is profoundly shocking. Everyone in town felt sorry for the couple
            and for their children.</p>
        <p>But the couple did not feel sorry for themselves. They had had their six children
            deliberately, and planned to have more. They found that their relief checks and
            allowances for disability increased with each child, and only as a large family could
            they be comfortable. They and two or three blind children would just subsist.</p>
        <p>This is an extreme but not isolated case of what happens in this country, a country where
            for generations there has been a great deal of talk about improving the quality of our
            population. It is true that there has been a lack of sound factual knowledge behind much
            of the talk. Even the experts----one is tempted sometimes to say especially the
            experts----do not know just what hereditary factors make for improved quality. But one
            does not need to be a scientist to know that there are some factors which degrade the
            quality of population.</p>
        <p>Not all of these are hereditary by any means. We do not know that mentally retarded
            parents will have mentally retarded children. But we do know that mentally retarded
            parents cannot bring up their children in the way that will produce valuable citizens,
            not without a great deal more help than is often available. We do know that when a
            couple have produced several blind children, or several deformed children, or several
            mentally deficient children, they should not in the interest of themselves and in the
            interest of society produce any more.</p>
        <p>It is time that we as communities with a sense of responsibility for our citizens, which
            means ourselves, should do something about a situation. The answer to much of the
            problem is a program of sterilization.</p>
        <p>The word has acquired some unpleasant connotations which it does not deserve. The Nazi
            idea of sterilizing whole groups of the population or individuals with whom the
            authorities did not agree or whom the authorities did not like has made Americans
            properly cautious as to trusting anyone with a sterilization program. Misunderstanding
            of what the word implies has left many with fears that are not justified. Therefore it
            is well to define first the word and the program we are discussing.</p>
        <p>Sterilization, in either man or woman, is a simple, safe and almost painless operation
            which does not disable the individual for more than a few hours. It does not impair
            sexual vigor. It does permanently and irrevocably bar reproduction. In women, the usual
            operation consists of tying off the Fallopian tubes so that male sperm cannot reach the
            ovum to fertilize it. In men, the usual operation consists of tying off a tiny duct
            called the vas deferens so that the male sperm does not
            join the rest of the ejaculate and therefore does not enter the female genital tract.
            Insert next in 25 and of the 25 state having sterilization laws *add</p>
        <p>The program in this country at least, does not involve compulsory features. No one here
            proposes that some official be endowed with the authority to order anyone to be
            sterilized. What we do contend for is the right of the individual to know what
            sterilization would mean to him or her, to have the facilities for: the operation if
            desired and to be protected in life afterwards. </p>
        <p>At present, sterilization programs under State laws are carried out chiefly in
            institutions. Most of those who are sterilized are mentally deficient or are suffering
            from some incurable transmissible diseases which leads them and their medical advisers
            to recommend the operation. How many similar individuals are sterilized under private
            auspices by their private physicians is unknown. Even the physicians are unable to
            estimate it. Even the number of sterilizations performed in institutions is not
            known.</p>
        <p>In large part, the institutional sterilizations are a medical problem. Most of the debate
            on sterilization as a method for improving the quality of peoples, the eugenic debate,
            has been on the level of prejudice and preconceived opinions. But there are facts upon
            which to base a more sober judgement.</p>
        <p>The best experience is that of Sweden. For just ten years, since July 1,
            1941, the sterilization program has been combined with general measures for improvement
            of family life and population quality. Birth control, maternal care, aid to families
            where desirable and sterilization are all employed. The result has been an increased
            birth rate for wanted, healthy babies and a decrease in accidental, undesired and
            dangerous births.</p>
        <p>The results have recently been appraised by Dr. Philip
                Weintraub of the United States. On the sterilization part,
            He finds that there is a steady increase in the number of operations each year. In the
            first six and a half years (for which complete statistics were compiled) there had been
            12,500 operations, of which 7,000 had been performed on the mentally deficient with a
            view to decreasing the number of children born with mental defects. For the rest,
            sterilizations have been performed largely for the blind, deaf mutes and others whose
            misfortunes are transmissible. </p>
        <p> Dr. Weintraub quotes with approval Swedish scientists who have reported such a program
            over a period of ten generations would reduce the number of such tragic births to
            one-fourt of the present volume. However, as he notes, sterilization for this purpose has long been recognized in Sweden as the most effective
                solution of the problem of the mentally inadequate.</p>
        <p>In our own country, a program for the prevention of such unnecessary tragedies is long
            overdue. It can be achieved not only by the action of the individual and the
            institution, but by the active support of the government. Sterilization is a health
            measure, a preventive health measure which can avert many of the tragedies of our
            families. Few people would deliberately encourage the reproduction of such unfortunates
            as now fill our hospitals and institutions. Yet it is as bad to permit their
            reproduction by our indifference or neglect of positive preventive measures.</p>
        <p>It should be the duty of government not only to supply the facilities which will enable
            these unfortunates to be sterilized, but to protect them afterwards. There should be
            provision for a pension of subsidy for those couples whose procreation would be
            dangerous to the community. If they are denied the normal family, not only for their own
            benefit but for that of society and above all of their children, society could well
            afford to see that they are well protected. If anyone thinks that is a bribe to
            encourage sterilization of the merely poor, he mistakes human nature.</p>
        <p>However, the sterilization program should not be confined to the physically or mentally
            inadequate. The program has wider implications and a broader application.</p>
        <p>In my own work, I have seen throughout the world the tragedies of parents overburdened by
            larger numbers of children than they can rear in decency. The birth control movement
            sprang from need of mothers and babies. When we opened our first birth control clinics,
            the majority of our patients were women who were already struggling with the problems of
            too frequent and too rapid pregnancies. There are still far too many of them, even in
            our favored country. But the mark of our success has been that more and more young
            couples are coming to our birth control clinics and to their private physicians to get
            advice on the spacing of their children before they are overwhelmed with the arrival of
            babies they cannot support. Those of us who have struggled all these years to give birth
            control its proper place in our medical and public health picture are proud and grateful
            that so much has been done.</p>
        <p>Birth control, however, is not the answer to all our problems. No one knows better than
            those who have worked in the birth control movement that this is so. We have never
            presented it as a panacea for the world&#8217;s ills. Birth control is just what the words
            imply----control, not abolition. It is one of the cornerstones of family life for
            couples who want children and can bring into the world healthy babies with a chance in
            life. Conception control measures are adopted by those couples who wish to space the
            arrival of their children.</p>
        <p>Birth control, then, is for the great majority. But there is an important minority of our
            population, and of every country&#8217;s population, who for reasons which they are valid in
            society or for the individual need a more decisive limitation of their child-bearing.
            These are by no means always the mentally and physically inadequate.</p>
        <p>In birth control work, we find that there are always a certain proportion of women who
            for one reason or another cannot manage conception control methods, as we know them now,
            with assurances of success. There are women with insurmountable blocks, stemming in part
            at least from their early sex education or lack of it, against using birth control
            measures. A rather common example is the woman who as a girl was taught so sternly that
            any touching of the genital organs is wicked that she never overcomes her aversion.
            Sometimes physicians or counsellors can overcome these blocks; not always. Then there
            are the incorrigibly careless. There are also the couples who have as many children as
            they believe they can rear. This may be any number, and the only people who can decide
            what that number should be is the couple themselves.</p>
        <p>For all these people, sterilization is the common sense procedure. They are entitled to
            it as surely as any person who is mentally or physically inadequate. For their
            individual happiness, their arguments are inescapable. They and their children are
            condemned to a species of slavery, of forced labor under oppressive conditions, which
            inability to control their fecundity imposes upon them.</p>
        <p>The value of a sterilization program to the community is even more apparent. Science as
            yet has made few strides toward determining just which undesirable or unfortunate
            physical and mental traits are inherited and how. A purely eugenic pattern for
            sterilization, therefore, is opposed by some on the grounds that we do not know enough
            about eugenics to make it work. There is no such argument against the sterilization of
            those groups I have mentioned.</p>
        <p>If there is one thing that our studies of the family have proved, it is that the healthy
            emotional and physical development of a child draws its greatest strength from the home
            environment. Innumerable studies have proved that an overwhelming proportion of our
            criminals, our maladjusted individuals, our mental cases where no hereditary factor can
            be determined come from families where the children were either not wanted or came in
            such profusion that they overwhelmed the abilities of the parents to care for them.</p>
        <p>It is not enough to say that society should be so organized that the parents could care
            for them. Improvement in the standard of living would take care of only a few of these
            cases. The underprivileged child is more than an economic symbol. Food, clothing and
            shelter are basic, of course, but they are not enough. The affection and attention of
            parents is equally essential. Not every parent can bestow these gifts upon the same
            number of children. One couple may very well be good parents for eight or ten. Another
            couple with equal economic resources may be incapable of doing their duty by more than
            one or two----may even be poor parents altogether, resentful and demanding.</p>
        <p>Every child is so much the product of his environment, and the home is so much the most
            important element in his environment, that the quality of our citizens depends upon the
            family. We hardly need the new sciences of psychiatry and sociology to tell us that. But
            if we have any doubts from our own observation of the world, those sciences resolve
            them.</p>
        <p>It is one of the world&#8217;s tragedies that knowledge seems always to be far ahead of the
            application of the knowledge. In the matter of sterilization, science has developed
            harmless, safe, virtually painless techniques. Yet few people know of them, and millions
            still believe that sterilization is a form of mutilation from which everyone
            shrinks.</p>
        <p>As in every other health program, therefore, the first step to be taken is a broad
            educational campaign. An informed people is a healthy people.</p>
        <p>We in this country have developed splendid techniques for health education. We have only
            to consider how greatly we have expanded general knowledge of such scourges as cancer
            and heart disease and tuberculosis, how we have virtually wiped out dread plagues, how
            we have improved maternal and child care. We have done wonders in teaching people the
            facts about these medical and health problems.</p>
        <p>When it comes to teaching them the facts about the even more basic problem of their own
            reproduction, we grow timid. Such a course is hardly worthy of our intelligence or our
            abilities. It only needs the will and the interest to place sterilization in its proper
            place among our basic health programs. The methods which have ben proved elsewhere will
            then become effective.</p>
        <p>There is the nucleus of the necessary organization in the Human Betterment
                Association of America. There is a growing awareness of the problem among
            educators, doctors and publicists----as is indicated by the fact that a leading national
            magazine prints such an article as this. There is a background of success in breaking
            with hidebound tradition as is shown by the progress of the birth control movement and
            the current spread of sounder sex education. These are real educational forces. If they
            are liberated, expanded and supported, the progress which science has made in providing
            us with modern sterilization techniques can make its great contribution to human
            happiness and welfare.</p>
