        <h1>EDUCATION AND THE BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC</h1>
        <h3>By Margaret Sanger</h3>
        <p>More than thirty thousand women have written to me, baring the secrets of their souls and
            the secrets of their bodies. Most of them are mothers or have been mothers. All of them
            love their children. Most of them love their husbands. All of them plead for help. They
            cry for deliverance from the torture of incessant pregnancy and childbirth. Through
            their letters, often misspelled and sometimes illiterate, I can hear the suppliant
            voices of this tragic chorus of mothers -- a chorus 
       &#8593;more moving than that of
                an&#8595;
     old Greek tragedy, a chorus which 
       &#8593;reiterates endless its&#8595;
    
            monotonous plea for liberation. Despite the ever accumulating number of these letters,
            the inarticulate tragedies they recount vary but slightly. Over and over again I read
            the same tale - that of the young wife caught in the tangled mesh of involuntary
            maternity, the birth of the first child, the rapidly repeated pregnancies, the breakdown
            of health, the quicksands of poverty threatening to engulf the growing family, the death
            of the children, the helplessness, the hopelessness of life, the desperate supplication
            for help....</p>
        <p> Painful as every one of these letters has been, they have compelled me to continue to
            fight for the legitimization of education in birth control. Opponents of the doctrine of
            contraception very often accuse us of fanaticism. Birth Control is a theory, they like
            to repeat, that is offered as a panacea for all existing social evils. Its practice is
            revolting, they continue, to the delicate sensibilities of the average woman. The menace
            of Birth Control, they glibly explain, lies in the dictatorship it would 
       &#8593;attempt
                to&#8595;
     set up over marriage and parenthood. Based 
       &#8593;as they are&#8595;
     on a
            complete and bland indifference to actual conditions in our workaday world, such
            arguments are purely hypothetical and academic and do not merit serious consideration.
            The one irrefutable answer is to be found in these letters from 
       &#8593;living and&#8595;
    
            suffering mothers. How can our opponents, in the slang expression, laugh <span class="underline">them</span> off?</p>
        <p> These letters express, in stammering and inarticulate style, the crying demand for
            instruction in Birth Control. They demonstrate, beyond the shadow of doubt, that Birth
            Control education has arisen in response to a real need of thousands upon thousands of
            wives and mothers. No one is trying to thrust the doctrine upon an unwilling public. No
            one is trying to corrupt young girls. No one is trying to destroy the institution of
            holy matrimony. 
       &#8593;Even if we were depraved enough to wish to do so,&#8595;
     our hands
            are too busy 
       &#8593;at the present moment,&#8595;
     in what <span class="del">for want of a better term,
            </span> we can only describe as <span class="underline">emergency</span> measures in
            attempts to save from eventual destruction 
       &#8593;the lives of&#8595;
     mothers who have
            already been grievously wounded in the battle of life. Emergency measures are
            imperative. But emergency measures are <span class="del">at the present moment</span> not sufficient.
            To succor the fallen is not enough. We must have the courage and the foresight to plan a
            programme of prevention to circumvent the recurrence of the traditional and tragically
            extravagant method of bringing children into our world. For the traditional method is
            wasteful of everything civilization holds most precious: wasteful of the lives of women
            and children, wasteful of money, wasteful of time, wasteful of vital energies.</p>
        <p> Fortunately we have discovered such a programme of prevention. Its nucleus lies in the
            Birth Control clinic. These clinics have already demonstrated their practicability and
            the tangible relief suffering women have derived from them <span class="del">It is not enough,
                however,</span>. Merely to effect the removal of the various legal restrictions, now
            existent in Great Britain and the United States, and which
            hamper the complete functioning of such clinics, 
       &#8593;this is not sufficient,&#8595;
    
            immediately necessary as this step is. The seed of this vital idea has been sown.
            Despite the rockiness of the soil and all the obstructions placed in its way, 
       &#8593;this
                seed&#8595;
     has germinated. We must now insure its growth, its development, its
            eventual blossoming into maturity. To rest content with Birth Control clinics as mere
            sporadic, ameliorative, or local instruments of maternity welfare would be a sad
            confession of a limited vision of its innate potentialities.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="del">There is</span>
            
       &#8593;We hear&#8595;
     a good deal of talk nowadays <span class="del">of</span>
            
       &#8593;concerning&#8595;
     the necessity of adult education. The Birth Control clinic, as I
            see it, can be developed into the finest and surest method of 
       &#8593;a type of&#8595;
     adult
            education that is fundamentally educational and basically adult. 
       &#8593;One&#8595;
     tenet of
            contemporary pedagogy, I believe, is that true education must be based upon the needs
            and the vital interests of the pupil. The first requisite of the educator is the
            discovery of those vital interests and needs, so that they may be directed or
            channelized into normal, sane and healthy paths. Only when he taps this reservoir of
            vital energy is the teacher at all able to hold the attention of his pupils. Only thus
            can he &#8220;e-duc-ate&#8221; them at all, (for the very word means &#8220;to lead out&#8221;). My thirty
            thousand and more letters from suffering mothers convince me that here at hand is a vast
            reservoir of deep, human interest demanding to be &#8220;led forth&#8221; out of the darkness of
            despair into the light of sane living. When society at large has taught the mass of
            women how <span class="del">to master</span> and control their essential physiological functions,--in
            short, when it has taught them mastery of their own bodies--it may then reasonably
            expect them to show something more than a languid interest in the care and proper
            feeding of their infants and the hygiene of their homes. But while it 
       &#8593;skips over
                this first and most important&#8595;
     in maternal education, while it refuses to base
            its teaching on the <span class="underline">initial demand</span> of its pupil, it need
            expect very little certainty of progress in the politer though less important arts of
            life.</p>
        <p> By answering <span class="del">, resolutely and with infinite 
        [<em>patience</em>]
    </span> the fundamental demand of every adult woman, the
            Birth Control clinic places in her hand the key of self-mastery and self-direction. Once
            the young wife <span class="del">and mother</span> has been sympathetically taught how she can master
            her maternal function, she is no longer a slave but a comparatively free woman. Her
            whole psychology changes. &#8220;Adult education&#8221; becomes, in her case, no mere catchword but
            an actual possibility. I <span class="del">have actually </span>
       &#8593;myself have&#8595;
     witnessed this
            change of attitude in women who have personally applied to me for help and whose cases I
            have 
       &#8593;followed&#8595;
     during a period of years. Incidentally, I may remark that
            nothing is more encouraging to the Birth Control worker that to watch this gradual
            change from a slave-mother into a free and developing adult woman. The efficacy of this
            type of true education - it has little or nothing to do with the veneer of &#8220;culture&#8221; of
            the women&#8217;s clubs -- is further demonstrated in the robust health of the children,
            brought into the world through a system of proper spacing, and therefore not crowding
            upon the overworked mother&#8217;s energies.</p>
        <p> Not only by increasing the efficiency of women as actual mothers may the well-organised
            Birth Control clinic develop its educational potentialities; it may no less legitimately
            point the way to happier and therefore more enduring marital relationships. Our
            distinguished opponents may object that mere secular agency has the right to interfere
            in the private relationships of man and wife. But in the past church and state and
            society at large - including the press - have never been loath to give advice generously
            and gratuitously concerning the various roads to happiness in marriage, all of them
            omitting, strangely enough, any reference to specifically physiological aspects of the
            problem. <span class="del">The clinic, </span>With its protective privacy and its specific
            consideration of each particular case and its scientific impersonality the 
       &#8593;Birth
                Control Clinic can&#8595;
     with cleanliness and decency extend aid and constructive
            suggestions which would accomplish 
       &#8593;much&#8595;
     more toward preventing marital
            shipwreck than all the glib generalisations of conventional moralists. Here, as in its
            other activities, the aim would be to prevent unhappiness and misery rather than to
                
       &#8593;alleviate&#8595;
     conditions that should never in any civilisation worthy of the
            name, have been permitted to develop.</p>
        <p> Fear of pregnancy often acts as a powerful deterrent to satisfactory marital relations
            between husband and wife. The act which should be fulfilled as a physical and spiritual
            communion, sealing the bonds of matrimony, cementing mutual love, and periodically
            renewing the love between husband and wife, is 
       &#8593;habitually&#8595;
     dreaded and avoided
            by women who have suffered agonies because of <span class="del">earlier consequences </span>
       &#8593;an
                unhappy 
        [<em>situation</em>?]
    &#8595;
    . <span class="del">An ever </span>A widening chasm of
            dissatisfaction is created. The young husband often seeks consolation outside the home.
            Yet even the restricted or limited relations do not prevent the coming of new children
            into the unhappy family. With its ministrations, the Birth Control clinic really makes
            possible strong and more enduring marriage relations, and in so doing, assures a firmer
            foundation for the founding of the family.</p>
        <p> When we stop to consider the vast sum-total of misery, of unhappiness, of destructive
            and misspent energy, which is generated not of some petty misunderstanding,
                
       &#8593;irresponsibility&#8595;
     or maladjustment, of the cost not merely to the two
            individuals, but to society at large, we can but wonder why, in the very interests of
            human and societal economy, sexual education - no less than reading, writing and
            arithmetic - has not been made compulsory by law. Would it not have been more
            economical, in the longrun than the vast, complicated administration of divorce laws, or
            the maintenance of founding homes and &#8220;welfare&#8221; centres?</p>
        <p> Is my conception of the educational possibilities of the Birth Control clinic purely
            visionary and Utopian? If it is then any practical, constructive, and tested agency
            serving fundamental human needs must also be condemned as Utopian. On the contrary:
            modest and tentative as the activities of the clinics in their pioneer stage 
       &#8593;have
                been&#8595;
    , 
       &#8593;nevertheless&#8595;
     they rest upon a sound foundation and method.
            Just as the comparatively modern science of sanitation and public health developed its
            technique of prevention in combatting epidemics and contagion, and just as modern
            medicine has gradually shifted its efforts from remedial measures to preventative
            therapy, so the Birth Control clinic points the way to philanthropy and organized
            charity toward what James Mill, something more
            than a century ago, called the drying up of one of the most copious sources of evil in
            society.</p>
        <p> There is yet another important type of education which may be vastly aided through the
            agency of the Birth Control clinic. This type I would characterize as the education of
            the educators. Nothing is more dangerous nor more productive of fallacy than the habit
            of generalising concerning human nature on the basis of insufficient evidence. Immediate
            and prolonged contact with men and women is necessary. 
       &#8593;Just&#8595;
     conclusions can
            be drawn only upon a thorough familiarity and comprehension of the problems of the
            common lot. The ordinary run of women resent--and I think very rightly resent--the
            prying into their private affairs by the so-called &#8220;social&#8221; worker, the agents of
            organized charities and philanthropies which their coldly statistical aid. While they
            have been ready and willing to accept such benefits as they can, 
       &#8593;the poor&#8595;
    
            have often 
       &#8593;concealed&#8595;
     with amazing skill and craftiness the real truths
            concerning their lives from the visiting agent. This is a fact commonly recognised by
            charity workers, who become adept in breaking down the walls of reticence. When they do,
            they discover, as many of them have confessed to me, that the chief cause of destitution
            has not been predominantly an economic one, but its organically bound up with
            uncontrolled fertility.</p>
        <p> Now the clinic does not send agents or charity workers into homes where they are not
            wanted or invited. It does not even pretend to be a charity or a philanthropy. It avoids
            any tendency toward pauuperising the poor or dictating any set rules of behaviour. Its
            administration is conducted on a basis of equality and mutual dignity. Realizing that we
            can never get at the radical truth without first inspiring confidence, the most
            successful clinics are now actually in the process of developing a new technique in
            social work. We are discovering, for example, heretofore unsuspected resources of
            intelligence and a deep-rooted desire for self-improvement among those very classes
            which had been glibly described as reckless and irresponsible. What had been lacking,
            what had universally been refused them by chairty workers and social agencies, had been
            the very thing they were clamouring for - the means of preventing 
       &#8593;undesired&#8595;
    
            pregnancy, and the opportunity to devote themselves to the upbringing of a few children,
            rather than to be swamped physically and economically, by an ever-increasing broad.
