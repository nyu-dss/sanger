                World Resources in Relation to Family was introduced by Lady Gertrude Denman who said in part It
                was entirely owing to Mrs. Margaret Sanger's
                enthusiasm and generosity that the present Congress had been called together.
                (Applause) She could perhaps best sum up what they all felt and thought about Mrs.
                Margaret Sanger by quoting from an American official document, which said that the
                    America Women's Association Medal was given to Mrs. Sanger "for her vision, integrity and valour." No one could have a better
                tribute than that..Sanger used this same address at the Pioneers Luncheon given by the Planned Parenthood
                Association at the Palmer House in Chicago. This luncheon was the Opening Event of the 1950 Nationwide Planned
            Parenthood Campaign.For an slightly edited version, "Survey of the Birth Control

        <h1>Address by Mrs. Margaret Sanger</h1>
        <p>I am really quite moved tonight to have this reception, and terribly pleased. I thought
            that the one reception last night was quite sufficient, but I am flattered by having a
            special affair of this kind, and I thank the Committee very much for this honour. Although I was told that I must not do
            much thanking, nevertheless I must say a word of thanks to a few friends who helped in
            the beginning to get me going for this Congress -- Dr. Blacker, Dr. Griffith, Mr.
                Chance (who I regret is not here) and, of
            course, always the Guys, and Mrs. Helena
                Wright.</p>
        <p>Always in England there have been these various splendid friends. It seems
            to me that it has been like a great tapestry of human endeavour, the birth control work
            between England and the United States, and I think it will continue as it
            began, some 25 or 30 years ago. </p>
        <p>The Committee has asked me to give you briefly a summary of the birth control movement.
            If I were to do that, I should keep you here until the morning, and so when this letter
            came to me I had an idea for doing it in a different way, and I got out a pamphlet on
            150 years of birth control, from Malthus
            to Cheltenham. I want to give the first copy to
            Lord Horder, and the next to Lady Denman, and copies to all the speakers here; and all
            the delegates will also have a special copy later. (Applause).</p>
        <p>Having said that, and having given a summary of the movement in this pamphlet, I can now
            ramble on.</p>
        <p>There are just a few things for which I take credit in this great humanitarian movement,
            and the first, which I consider much more important than most people do, is that I
            coined a term to call the movement by. A few of us got together, and we knew that there
            were such terms as &#8220;Malthusianism,&#8221; &#8220;Neo-Malthusianism,&#8221; and &#8220;Conscious generation,&#8221; but
            you know that the Americans just could not even spell them, let alone pronounce them,
            and I know that they would not do. We tried one term after another, including &#8220;Family
            Control,&#8221; and then &#8220;Birth Control&#8221; came, as it were, out of the air, and &#8220;Birth Control&#8221;
            it was.</p>
        <p>It needed a little describing, and so for years some of us went throughout the country,
            from east to west and north to south, defining it as &#8220;The conscious control of the
            birth-rate by means that prevent conception.&#8221; We emphasised the word &#8220;prevent&#8221; --
            prevent, not destroy; not to interfere with life, but to prevent when there was no life
            to destroy. We said &#8220;This is no more destruction of life than you remaining single or
            living in celibacy.&#8221;</p>
        <p>We said &#8220;control,&#8221; and we did not mean &#8220;limit.&#8221; We did not mean one child or two
            children; we said &#8220;control,&#8221; and we emphasised that you control traffic and appetite and
            temper. We thought that those were two excellent words to pin to this idea. I consider
            that that was probably one of the best educational factors in the whole movement. While
            the name has since been changed, and I think very well, to &#8220;Family Planning,&#8221; that
            simply means that the movement has gone on and got beyond where it needed to be
            explained, and we are getting into another realm. I especially like the term &#8220;Planned
            Parenthood.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Another thing which was interesting and quite delightful was challenging the Comstock laws. It is impossible for those of you
            who live in England and other countries to conceive what an atmosphere there was in the
            United States in 1912-14. A man named Anthony Comstock, more than thirty years before,
            conceived the idea, and influenced Congressmen and churchmen and others to accept it,
            that the only way to keep the people pure was to make laws to keep them pure, and so he
            went to Congress and was able to get a law
            passed which covered abortion and contraception, and which made it a crime, punishable
            with five years&#8217; imprisonment and a 5,000 dollar fine, for anyone to send through the
            post any book or letter or article or information concerning contraception or where it
            might be obtained; and that did not exclude the medical profession. In different States
            he also had laws passed which did not exclude the medical profession; and so for thirty
            years this man -- fanatical and well-meaning -- and his agents opened letters. They had
            more privileges than Congressmen. They opened parcels and packages from abroad, and
            especially from France, looking for contraceptives and for literature that might mention
            sex. The very words &#8220;gonorrhea&#8221; and &#8220;syphilis&#8221; were taboo, and whole papers were
            prevented from going through the U.S. mails if those words were included in any part of
            them.</p>
        <p>It was a serious matter; it was not just a question of threats. He sent people to jail.
            An editor 70 years old was sent to the penitentiary
            and put to hard labour, breaking rocks; his crime was editing a magazine -- I hope Dr.
            Blacker will take note of this -- called the Eugenics
                Review. In the end the public indignation was aroused by the arrest of a
                dealer who had in his window a beautiful picture
            of a little girl of about ten years of age, nude, with the sunlight in her hair,
            standing in a stream. It was so beautiful that crowds gathered round the window to look
            at it, and the Comstock agent arrested them and the bookseller. This aroused the wrath
            of some of the friends of freedom, and it was not so easy for him to arrest people after
            that.</p>
        <p>This was the situation when, as someone said, &#8220;Margaret Sanger came upon the
                scene with three children in her arms and a wild look in her eye.&#8221; I had the
            children, and I had the wild look too, because I had been working among women -- poor,
            depressed, forgotten women -- whose whole lives were lives of misery, who were asking
            people what they could do so as not to have another baby, because they had more children
            than they could take care of, and perhaps their husbands were out of work, yet more and
            more children came. Some mothers who had had large families were asking what to do to
            save their daughters from the hardships and the life of drudgery that they had
            experienced. Everywhere I went I found people with this problem. I myself, with three
            children and with a long period of tuberculosis, knew that this was a very important
            matter, and the question was just what to tell them, what to say.</p>
        <p>I was perfectly willing to tell them what to do, but what was I to tell them? There was
            nothing in the public libraries, and even in the medical libraries in New York all that I could find on the subject was a book
            by a German physician with pages and pages on how
            wonderful it was to have children. That was as much as I could get from any medical
            treatise at that period.</p>
        <p>Going to France and to Scotland gave me a new idea of the
            importance of this question. I went to Glasgow to
            see what municipal ownership had done for women and children. They had had municipal
            ownership there for 25 years, and had beautiful parks and houses. I found, however, that
            none of the apartment houses were built for more than four children, and I asked what
            would happen if there were five children in the family. I was told &#8220;We have
                no facilities for anyone with more than four children, and as a matter of fact we do
                not encourage people with more than one or two children to live in these houses,
                because after they have four children the parents are unable to take care of the
                houses or the children, and so they have to go to other districts.&#8221; I found
            families with seven or eight children down in the dockyard slums.</p>
        <p>That made me think that no matter what the political situation, no matter what the
            economic situation, unless something is done to help people to take care of themselves
            the best places in the world may be turned into slums.</p>
        <p>Then I saw France, where there was real family limitation, where back to
            the days of Napoleon there had been some
            consideration given to children and to the responsibility of having children. That is
            important. French women thought not only of themselves but of their children, and far
            more care was given to the one or two children per family that I saw in France than to
            the children that I saw in Glasgow.</p>
        <p>That, then, was one of the reasons for my having a wild look. I realised that this thing
            could do far more than protect the individual woman who had tuberculosis or kidney
            trouble and who would not live if she had children; it involved a very large social
            outlook as well.</p>
        <p>I decided, therefore, that I had to challenge the Comstock law. As things stood, we could
            not get anywhere; we could not get information from any other part of the world; we
            could not even discuss the matter without having difficulties and without being
            threatened with jail sentences. I accordingly got out a little pamphlet called Family Limitation, a very simple one, with what formulas I had
            found in Paris and elsewhere, the folklore ideas of
            contraception; but it served its purpose of bringing the Comstock law to heel.</p>
        <p>I had difficulty in getting it printed, because every printer whom we approached said &#8220;This means a jail sentence; this means Sing-Sing.&#8221; which is our famous
            prison up the river. Nevertheless, we found a courageous printer who printed the
            pamphlet at night, and it was all set. I could have been given about 45 years in prison.
            It was like Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh over here; they printed a
            pamphlet and challenged the law, and I think that from that time onwards your English
            law has been straightened out and you have had no difficulty on any question of
            contraception here. I thought that that was a good example and that I would do the same,
            and so I had this pamphlet written in plain terms for women to read, printed.</p>
        <p>I printed 125,000 or more, and had them carefully wrapped in bundles, and then I took the
            boat for England. When I was in the middle of the ocean I gave the word, and these
            pamphlets went out to the miners and the cotton workers and throughout the country to
            people who needed them, and to a judge and a district attorney and one of these Comstock
            officials. I said that I had come away to prepare for a trial, and that I felt that this
            was an important matter and the only way to call attention to these laws and get them
            changed. There was such a thing as dramatisation of the situation. </p>
        <p>There is a wonderful statement that Shaw made
            which I have used many times. He said that tragedies really do not amount
                to very much; if an aeroplane crashes a dozen or more people are killed, and if an
                engine goes off the track more people are killed, and that may also happen if a
                great theatre or other building catches fire; but then something is done to prevent
                the same sort of thing from happening again. The real tragedies of the world are the
                little, everyday, continuous miseries, day in and day out, year after year and
                sometimes century after century, which we took in our stride; we got used to
                them. I thought that that was very true of the women who were bearing children
            that they did not want to have to bear in ignorance; and so I brought out this little
            pamphlet.</p>
        <p>I came over to England, and I had a wonderful reception here. I found that there were a
            great many people here who rather liked law-breakers. My memory goes back to the very
            splendid help that I had from Havelock Ellis,
                H. G. Wells, Edward Carpenter, J. M.
            Keynes, and the wonderful Drysdales. Dr. Alice Vickery and the
            whole Drysdale family had carried on this
            movement from the times of Annie Besant and Bradlaugh, and were real Malthusians in
            their teachings. They helped and guided me in my work.</p>
        <p>About the time, therefore, that I was prepared to appear in court and, I hoped, shake the
            foundations of the American continent, large numbers of people wrote to the judge telling their stories. Many wastepaper
            baskets were filled with their letters. He could not read them. He said to the attorney
                &#8220;Take those out. What are we doing to this Mrs. Sanger?&#8221; In no
            time at all, the case was dropped.</p>
        <p>That was not much good; we did not get anywhere. A very distinguished attorney said &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to
                prosecute Mrs. Sanger, a little frail woman; she will never do this again. We know
                Mrs. Sanger.&#8221; I said &#8220;Oh, do you?&#8221; I would not promise not to do it; I said &#8220;As
            long as there is a woman in the world that needs this information, I am afraid that I
            shall have to give it to her.&#8221;</p>
        <p>There was also an influential letter -- and I would here pay tribute to Marie Stopes, who initiated it -- with distinguished
            names from England, signed by the Bishop of
                Birmingham and ten or twelve others, including H. G. Wells, whose name
            meant a great deal in America. That was sent to the president of the United States, and the case was dropped.</p>
        <p>That, however, did not affect the Comstock law. It affected me; it freed me to go to the
            country and speak, but the law was still there. Comstock died, but the torch was handed
            onto others, and the law was still in operation, though not quite so viciously as
            before.</p>
        <p>While I was over here, I went to Holland and took a
            course in the technique of contraception, and so I was able to do something more
            practical than the pamphlet. I decided to set up in New York State,
            challenging the law, a clinic, very much on the lines of those in Holland, to which
            women could come and be given information suitable for them as individuals. That seemed
            to me to be the ideal way, especially in the United States, to have the information
            about contraception given. That clinic was closed in about ten days and everybody was
            arrested, but they went on hunger-strike and caused a great deal of concern to those
            tender men that liked tender women, but we won a court decision. We took it to the
            highest court in New York State, and at last we had a victory. It was laid down that if
            I had a medical practitioner it would be all right, and that any physician lawfully
            practising could give contraceptive information for the cure or prevention of disease.
            With that we were satisfied; it was one step forward, and the only decision that we had.
            It interpreted the New York State law, and at once we opened another clinic, which has
            been in operation ever since.</p>
        <p>We had Dr. Hannah Stone as the first woman
            physician. (Applause). She stood beside us, ready to take whatever came, as our medical
            director until her death. About 125,000 women have come to that clinic for instruction.
            We have another department, dealing with infertility, to help those who wish to have
            children, and under Dr. Levine we have marriage
            guidance, and so we have expanded our work to cover these other factors which belong to
            sex education.</p>
        <p>Finally, we even got a court decision on the federal law. We connived to get a package of
            pessaries to come from a doctor in Japan to a doctor in New York, and we said &#8220;Doctor to
            doctor. How about it?&#8221; The court decided that they could be received, doctor to doctor.
            We therefore had two decisions, and felt that we were able to go ahead. No one did it
            alone; we could not do it alone. There were thousands and thousands of people concerned.
            Every time I presented a case to an audience I felt that it was really their story. It
            really reached the people. The hierarchy and the officials did not know what we were
            talking about, but the people knew; it was their cause. We became the articulate
            spokesmen for the women of America.</p>
        <p>To my great delight, I was invited to go to Japan and to talk there at a
            sort of round table meeting with some very distinguished people. Einstein was to speak on relativity; Bertrand Russell was to speak on something or other
            that I have forgotten; I was to speak on population and peace, and H.G. Wells was to
            speak on reconstruction. When the time came, I was refused a visa by the Imperial Japanese Government and was stopped in
                California. On the boat which I was to have taken there were 125 very
            important Japanese coming from the Washington
                Disarmament Conference, including admirals and high officials in the Japanese
            Government. I felt that if only I could talk to them and convince them, Japan would not
            be going to war in a short time; because everyone knew that Japan would have to have war
            if she kept on increasing her population as she was increasing it, with a population
            half the size of that of the United States and an area not as large as
                California. All the doors of the world were closed against the
            Japanese, and they had no place to go except South America.
                Australia, Canada and the United States would not have
            them, and Europe was not taking very many of them; it did not have
            room.</p>
        <p>There then, was this terrific problem, and to my surprise, Japan did not want to hear it
            talked about. Some bright newspaperman, however, gave me the idea of going to
                China on the boat, and that was what I did; I got a visa for China
            and spent a great deal of time talking to the Japanese. I had a meeting with them in one
            of the great saloons on the boat, and they asked questions. They tried to get me into
            Japan, but it was difficult. The American
                Consul -- as usually happens on these occasions -- was out of town and we
            could not reach him, and so Americans had to turn to the British Consul to get them into Japan. He pulled
            wires and arranged things, and I found that I was able to get into Japan after all. </p>
        <p>I had a wonderful reception; the women waited all day, from eight in the morning until
            midnight, to receive me. It was very interesting and indeed symbolic to see the way in
            which these Japanese women tried to express in English what this idea was going to mean
            in Japan. One woman said to me &#8220;Mrs. Sanger, we have been hearing about
                suffrage, but we are not interested. We have been hearing about women having
                equality with men, but we do not care. But when we heard about birth control, like
                the lightning, the Japanese women were on to that,&#8221; I thought that that was very
            expressive -- &#8220;like lightning,&#8221; That is what women all over the world want, all the
            women of the world, everywhere; they want something which will allow them to take care
            of their children and give them a decent upbringing. </p>
        <p>In Japan, the officials took me to the police station and asked me what I was going to
            say. I found that my books had been translated without my permission, and I asked them
            how this had happened, but of course they never paid any attention to copyright rules;
            they just thought that knowledge must be good and must be free. I did not mind that
            particularly. Then we came to talk about birth control and what I was to say, and they
            went into a huddle and came back and said &#8220;You may talk as much as you wish
                on the intimate question of birth control and tell them all that they must do, but
                you must not mention population; that we do no believe in, and that is not part of
                the talk that you must give our women.&#8221; I said &#8220;I cannot talk about birth
            control among fishes; it means people. I have come to talk to women about birth control,
            and birth control means population.&#8221;</p>
        <p>I had many private meetings. I think that the only public one which they would allow was
            in the Y.M.C.A. which was again almost
            private. I never met a more alive and enthusiastic audience anywhere in the world. They
            felt and they knew what was happening; they knew that the militarists were trying to
            clutch the people. This was in 1921, and even then there was this feeling. One editorial
            on the subject said &#8220;The doors of the world have been shut in our faces. We
                will open them when we have a hundred million people. Might will make Right, and we
                will pay back that insult.&#8221; That was in 1921. They were very bitter about the
            law that had been passed in the United States to bar Asiatics. The Japanese had found
            very fertile soil in California, and had hoped to send more and more of their surplus
            population there. </p>
        <p>When in Japan I had a cable from China, from Mr. Hu-Shih,
            who later became Ambassador to the United States. Bertrand Russell had been there and
            had upset their family life considerably with new ideas, and I came along with this one
            about spacing children, and they were a little confused. Finally, they said &#8220;We will accept this whole idea of birth control, if you will tell us how
                to have boys; that is all we need.&#8221; I was not able to answer that one! China is,
            in a sense, not so well educated in this regard as we should like to have it. I have
            made three trips there since then. The medical profession has taken it up considerably,
            and the midwives also tried to do something to help, but in the midst of all this, while
            we were making headway, the war came, and the whole world has been disorganised since
            then. </p>
        <p>Clinics were set up in various places. India was one of the most
            encouraging. when people say the religions of the Asiatics are against contraception, I
            beg to correct that error. I never met any religious opposition in India, except in
                Travancore, where there were thirty or forty
            Portuguese missionaries who walked out of the Congress of the All India Women&#8217;s
                Conference. Of all the women of the world, I have never met finer and more
            intelligent women than I found in India, and there is no question about that.
            (Applause). I visited Gandhi, who did not
            believe in so-called &#8220;artificial&#8221; birth control; he believed in separation of husband
            and wife after they had had a number of children. He believed that India
            was over-populated, and he knew that this was one great cause of misery and poverty, but
            he would not concede that contraception was not a sin. To him it was a sin, and I found
            it difficult to talk with him; I can talk anatomy and physiology, but when it comes to
            sin I am lost. In spite of that, these magnificent women passed a resolution to have
            contraceptive information and technique taught in all the municipalities under the
            guidance of the health services. That was a very courageous thing for them to do. I am
            sure that now, as they become more established and settled, you will see the women of
            India taking a prominent place throughout the world. </p>
        <p>I am talking too long (Cries of &#8220;No&#8221;), but I want to tell you of one other thing that
            happened. The Comstock laws led to the difficulty that in the United States we had no
            contraceptives at all. We began to talk about birth control, and people said to us
            &#8220;Well, what do we do?&#8221; There was nothing practical or scientific. As a result of the
            course which I took at the Hague I found out
            about the diaphragm, but it was impossible to get it back to the United States. Havelock
            Ellis told me that just before the first world war there had been in a medical journal
            the announcement of a contraceptive jelly that had come out in Germany,
            and it had been registered as such and sold. It seemed wonderful, and I could hardly
            wait for the war to be over to go to Germany and find out about it. When the war was
            over, I went to Germany to find out what it was, not knowing the name of it or who it
            was that had invented or discovered it. </p>
        <p>I went to Berlin and Dresden and to many other places that are now shattered and gone, and
            finally I found out that there was a chemist at Friedrichshafen, near Switzerland, who had prepared this
            contraceptive jelly, but he would not give us the formula or tell us anything that was
            in it; he regarded it as something not to be disclosed. However, after a little
            persuasion -- I did not leave the place for about three days, and finally I broke him
            down -- he said he would send some to a relative of his in New York. It was specific for
            venereal disease, and so we could get it in. We straightened things out with the
            relative and found out all about it. </p>
        <p>From that time until now -- and this is what is so appalling -- those two things, the
            jelly and the diaphragm, have been the only things known. It seems absurd to me that we
            have been able to discover and make the atomic bomb and yet we have not yet got a really
            simple, good and harmless contraceptive. (Applause). </p>
        <p>I think that that is the end of this story. I have rambled on, but I should like to end
            by saying this. I think that one of the most important things for us is to realise the
            situation in the world to-day. We have all been practical idealists, but I do not think
            that we are optimists. The charming and delightful poet to whom we listened this
            morning, Sir John Boyd Orr, is an optimist, and I
            could not help thinking of the story of the man who went to the top of the highest
            building in New York, the Radio Centre, to look out over the beautiful scene to be seen
            from there. The building is about a hundred storeys high. In his enthusiasm for the
            view, he lent over too far and fell over the parapet. As in his fall he was passing the
            fifteenth storey, someone called out to him and he shouted &#8220;Everything is
                all right as far as I&#8217;ve gone.&#8221; As far as Sir John had gone it was all right,
            but where are we going? The optimist is out of place to-day, as we face reality and the
            hard facts. To be too optimistic is not healthy. </p>
        <p>(Applause).</p>
        <p>I feel that you are the people to carry on, to agitate and to educate the world. That is
            what needs doing; we must stir people up and make them think and feel and do, so that
            they do something that it is right to do for civilisation. In the United States we are
            spending billions on so-called welfare. If a fraction of that money were put into
            building laboratories and employing technicians to discover a form of contraception that
            could be taken into the jungles and the slums, the farms and the factories, we could
            place our civilisation on a firm road to survival. I have often repeated, and I repeat
            again, the words of Victor Hugo: &#8220;There is no force in the world so great as that of an idea whose hour has
                struck.&#8221; I believe that the hour of Malthus has struck. (Applause).</p>
