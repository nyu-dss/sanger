        <h1 class="underline">THE HERITAGE OF FEAR</h1>
        <h3>By Margaret Sanger</h3>
        <p>Babies who are brought into the world by mothers afraid of childbirth and fathers who
            resent offspring face many more than the ordinary perils of life. They inherit a legacy
            of fear; they grow up in an environment of nervous and emotional discord; they have the
            immense handicap of hate to overcome.</p>
        <p>It is not surprising that many of them never manage to overcome it. As a result society
            finds among them the great proportion of its delinquent children, its homosexuals, its
            psychotics, its sufferers from the psychosomatic diseases. </p>
        <p>The old fashioned moralists used to say comfortably that once a child was born there was
            some sort of magic called mother and father love which automatically transmuted fear
            into affection, nervous anxiety into calm competence in the rearing of infants. Of
            course it is true that the attitude of the parents sometimes will change during the
            course of a pregnancy and that a child will be welcomed by the time he arrives. (It is
            equally true that the change may be in the other direction and a planned baby will be
            rejected by its parents because they wanted one of the opposite sex or for some other
            reason.)</p>
        <p>But there are plenty of cases where the mother&#8217;s fear prevents her ever from being an
            adequate parent. Many of these cases never become dramatic enough to get into the
            statistics of crime, perversion or disease, but they are tragedies of equal magnitude. </p>
        <p>I recall, for example, one family who seemed outwardly to have every chance for
            happiness. The parents were exemplary church members of high moral character, adequately
            if not lavishly endowed with worldly goods. But the wife&#8217;s fears of pregnancy were
            intensified by a difficult labor in bearing her first child. After that she avoided her
            husband&#8217;s affection. She complained constantly of illness in order to have an excuse for
            preventing marital relations. The husband was puzzled and annoyed, resentful of the
            children whom he blamed for his wife&#8217;s attitude. Every act of intercourse, it seemed to
            him, produced a pregnancy, and in eight years the couple did have three children, all
            undesired. The father was especially open in showing it. </p>
        <p>In this home atmosphere there could be no room for the display of normally warm family
            affections. The children grew up feeling that their father was in the wrong and was
            worrying their mother constantly in ways which they could not understand. Their dislike
            of him hardened, and when the mother died, the children scattered and never were united
            with their father. A whole family had been embittered by the consequences of their
            mother&#8217;s fear, their father&#8217;s resentment and the ignorance of contraceptives which had
            prevented the couple from doing anything about it. </p>
        <p>The obvious consequences of bearing children in spite of fear and through ignorance is
            harshness and neglect. Not so obvious but equally harmful is the parent who reacts to
            the unwanted child with a feeling of guilt, and in order to compensate for it manages to
            &#8220;spoil&#8221; the child by too much protection, too much babying, too much exposure to
            unhealthy displays of affection. </p>
        <p>Miss Rhoda Milliken, head of the Women&#8217;s Division of the
                Washington Police Department, describes as typical of the juvenile delinquent
            a particularly difficult little boy who succeeded in carrying a brief career of theft,
            arson and petty property damage to a peak of shooting a night watchman. The child was
            eight years old at the time. The police finally got at the root of his trouble when he
            explained that he didn&#8217;t like his home because his mother had never wanted him anyway. </p>
        <p>This particular problem was solved by finding the child a foster home where he really was
            wanted. His delinquent habits fell away from him, and he was converted into a reasonably
            good citizen. </p>
        <p>Dr. Harvie Coghill, who has had exceptional
            opportunities for observation as director of the Children&#8217;s Memorial Clinic
            in Richmond, Virginia, reports: </p>
        <p>&#8220;the study of clinic files abounds in evidence that responsible thinking
                in relation to planned parenthood is imperative today.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Representative of these case was Billy, first referred to Dr. Coghill&#8217;s clinic at the age
            of nine by his school. Billy was a problem child to his teachers. It was found that his
            mother had tried to bring him up as a girl, and she could not be persuaded that her
            obvious rejection of a boy was bad for him. Seven years later Billy was sent back to the
            clinic by the Juvenile Court for homosexuality. </p>
        <p>Another boy from the Juvenile Court had committed a sadistic assault upon a smaller
            child. The mother so openly resented him that she said she hated to go to his school
            because she did not like people to know he was her son. </p>
        <p>Lucy was a clinic case because her parents had found her &#8220;spoiled, sucks her
                thumb, wets her bed, has nightmares, indulges in wanton destructiveness, temper
                tantrums, quarrels constantly, is jealous, lazy and engages in sex activities.&#8221;
            This was Lucy&#8217;s mother&#8217;s description. Neither mother of father had ever bothered to
            conceal from the little girl the fact that they had never wanted her, and she was taking
            a natural revenge. Dr. Coghill found that at school Lucy was entirely different. </p>
        <p>There are other reasons besides fear for not wanting children, but the psychiatrists find
            frightened mothers at the back of a good many of their more difficult cases. Dr. O. Spurgeon English, Temple
                University psychiatrist, says:</p>
        <p>&#8220;Let a child start life feeling unwanted, unloved and inferior, and there
                are no lengths to which he will not go to seek revenge upon a world which has
                neglected him and made him feel inferior. This can take the form of marital tyranny,
                religious or racial bigotry, industrial tyranny and sadism, or the despotic rule and
                destructive aggression of a dictator. On the other hand, let a man know peace and
                justice in his early home life and you have a man working to perpetuate a similar
                state of affairs in everything he touches.&#8221;</p>
        <p>The mother who has been afraid of having her baby usually reacts by jealousy of the
            infant if it is a girl and nagging if it is a boy. The child usually responds either by
            a more than natural clinging to his parents in the hope of getting some affection if he
            is persistent enough or by rebellion in the form of tantrums, physical retaliation
            against his parents or other children, stealing or other mischief. </p>
        <p>Many psychiatrists believe that the child is the chief sufferer from his parents&#8217; failure
            to plan their family intelligently. Dr. Karl
                Menninger, for instance, says:</p>
        <p>&#8220;The reason that contraceptive knowledge and counsel seem to the
                psychiatrist to be essential is based not upon considerations of the welfare of the
                adult but upon the considerations of the welfare of the child. Nothing is more
                tragic, more fateful in its ultimate consequences, than the realization by a child
                that he is unwanted. Where one child reacts to this in later life with an acute
                mental illness, dozens of children react to it in more subtle ways by developing
                self-protective barriers... This may show itself in a determined campaign or in a
                provocative program of attracting attention by offensive behavior and even criminal
                acts. Still more seriously it may show itself as a constant fear of other people or
                as a bitter prejudice against individuals or groups through deep-seated, easily
                evoked hatreds for them.&#8221;</p>
        <p>One remedy for all this potential and actual misery is an increasing knowledge on the
            part of others, that they can control the number and frequency of their children. As
            more and more of them become aware of the existence of Planned Parenthood
            centers, as more physicians become trained in the application of contraceptive
            techniques, as both physicians and mothers realize that in only two states
                (Massachusetts and Connecticut) is the furnishing of
            contraceptive advice illegal -- as we achieve progress in education, the heritage of
            fear which is being handed down to our children will be dissipated. </p>
        <p>All of us who have worked in the birth control movement know this to be true. We have
            seen for ourselves the lifting of an enormous burden of terror from women who had
            learned that they did not have to break their own health or ruin their existing
            children&#8217;s homes by living in the shadow of fear of another pregnancy. </p>
