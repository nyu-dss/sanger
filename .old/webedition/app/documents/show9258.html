        <h1>Should Women Know?</h1>
        <h3>By Margaret Sanger.</h3>
        <p>When the Constitution of the United States authorized Congress to establish post offices and post
            roads, it was not intended that the authority should go beyond this. It did not
            authorize it to censor the matter to be conveyed, nor to sit in judgement upon the
            moral, or intellectual qualities of the printed matter or parcel entrusted to it to
            deliver. The post office was, primarily, a mechanical institution, not an ethical one,
            whose business was efficiency, not religion or morality.</p>
        <p>But with the rapid falling away of Church influence among the people in United
                States within the last half century, it was necessary, if the Church would
            retain its hold upon the people, to lay its hands upon them in some subtle way, in which
            they would not be conscious of its power over them. This was done in 1873, by the
            passing of laws commonly known as the "Comstock laws," which prohibit the sending of any
            matter through the mails, which, according to the opinion or judgement of Anthony Comstock, the Postal Authorities see fit to call "obscene." </p>
        <p>Anthony Comstock was born in 1844, which makes him seventy-one years old next March. He
            has been Secretary and special agent for the Society for the Suppression of
                Vice since 1873--forty years--and also Post Office Inspector since the same
            year. Thus the Church, not daring to come out and to interfere with moral or religious
            principle openly, hides behind the closed doors of the "Suppression of Vice Society,"
            and works its poisonous way through the Government <span class="italics">via</span> its
            special agent, Comstock. </p>
        <p>Comstock records that he has destroyed 160 tons of literature, and brought 3,760
            "criminals" to "justice." In 1878, considerable agitation was aroused, and a petition
            presented to Congress, headed by the name of Robert Green Ingersoll, to which was added those
            of 70,000 "freemen" to repeal the laws known as the "Comstock laws." The petition
            measured over two-thousand feet in length, and was placed on file with the &gt;House Committee on the Revision of Laws. It prayed for the "
                repeal or modification of certain laws executed ostensibly to prevent the passage of
                obscene literature through the mails of the United States, but which laws have been
                and are being enforced to destroy the liberty of conscience in the matter of
                religion, against the freedom of the press, to the great hurt of the people,"
            etc., etc. Some years later the law was revised, removing the interference of religious
            prejudice, but holding to moral interference and prejudice more strongly than ever.
            Since that time there have been several attempts by individuals or groups to establish,
            and agitate for, freedom along moral lines. Persecutions have followed, especially when
            the agitations assumed printing form. One man in Chicago, well in the seventies, Moses
                Harmon, edited a paper called Lucifer, which
            came under the ban of this law. He was sentenced to imprisonment, year after year, but
            as soon as he came out of prison, he took up the fight again and again, for nearly ten
            years, until finally his health gave way through his sufferings and imprisonment, and he
            passed away. Many other writers, editors, and publishers have come into direct conflict
            with this law. The quality and standard of literature must remain subservient to an old
            fossilized opinion or die. </p>
        <p>Literature is not alone in this fight for its life--for, alas! even art is hampered by
            this law's existence. It is only a short time ago that the picture "September Morn,"
            made famous through Comstock suppression, was on exhibition in a window in New York City. It was the side-figure of a little girl,
            seen bathing in a pool of water, and painted in the nude; which so shocked the morals of
            Comstock that its removal was made necessary. Many other works of art, many magazines
            whose covers dare to exhibit an unclothed statue, are suppressed and confiscated by the
            Post Office through its special agent, Comstock.</p>
        <p>The latest and most flagrant disregard for the free press, was in the suppression and
            confiscation of the monthly publication, The Woman Rebel.
            This was a working woman's paper--the first of its kind ever issued in America. It
            carried on its banner "no gods, no masters." It had for its motto, "Working women, build
            up within yourselves a conscious fighting character against all things which enslave
            you"; and advocated for the working class the knowledge of the means to prevent
            conception.</p>
        <p>Its first number, in March 1914, was suppressed. The May, July, August, September, and
            October issues were all suppressed and confiscated because of articles in the paper
            discussing the importance of the workers controlling the size of their families. One
            article, called "Open Discussion," was suppressed for
            discussing discussion of the subject. Another article, entitled "The Birth Control League," which announced the organization of the league,org&gt;, and its outline of agitation, was
            suppressed also.</p>
        <p>The Woman Rebel did not advocate this knowledge, or the
            practice of this knowledge as a "cure all" for the workers from their present economic
            enslavement, but it did urge the practice of it as the most important immediate step
            which they should take toward their economic emancipation. Too long have the workers
            produced slaves for the enemy, children for the mills, soldiers and sailors for
                Mars. The time has come to cease at the fount of production, and
            watch the masters produce their own slaves for a while. </p>
        <p>At least the working woman should have the right to say if she wishes to become a mother
            or not. The women of the upper class have that right, for they have that knowledge, and
            the money with which to purchase such knowledge. But all obstacles are placed in the way
            for the working man's wife to obtain this, and any means to free herself from constant
            child-bearing. </p>
        <p>The Woman Rebel promised to give this knowledge to all who
            asked for it, and urged the working women to rally to its support in this just cause.
            The Federal Grand Jury returned three indictments against the editor on twelve counts,
            eleven of which were merely a discussion of the subject of birth control. No information
            was given in the paper's columns, but the very mention of the subject was considered
            obscene and entitled the editor to twelve years' imprisonment. A year in the Federal
            penitentiary for every count, with the indictment for the August, September, and October
            issues still pending.</p>
        <p>It is quite natural and consistent with capitalist laws, that there should be a heavy
            penalty for imparting this particular information among the workers, when we view these
            laws in the light of our present-day society. Industry in U.S.A. is comparatively new.
            It is reaching out in foreign lands to capture trade everywhere. To do this, it must
            undersell its rival competitors, and in order to undersell, it must make cheap goods,
            which, in turn, can be done only by cheap labor. The cheapest labor is that of women and
            children. The larger the size of the family, the earlier the children enter the
            factories.</p>
        <p>There is a brilliant example of this in the cotton-mills of the South, where little
            pale-faced children, nine and ten years of age, wend their weary way to the mills early
            in the winter mornings, before the sun is up, and return, after twelve hours' toil,
            after it has set. These little ones are just "helpers" to their mothers, who work in the
            mills also, while the father remains at home, cares for the younger children, and takes
            the noonday meal to his wife and children in the mills. The working people, in the
            cotton belt, average eight and nine children to a family, as they do in other industrial
            sections where child labor exists and wages run low.</p>
        <p>Almost all of the stock-holders of these mills are legislators, congressmen, etc., who
            have much to do in the making of the laws. So it is to their interest that child slaves
            be born into the world, and they will enforce the laws to that end. When women have the
            knowledge of the means to avoid producing hands, then will child-labor cease, and the
            few children born to the workers will be made welcome by society, and given fields and
            playgrounds in which to spend a healthful childhood instead of grinding their souls and
            bodies into profits as is done to-day.</p>
        <p>A large family of children is one of the greatest obstacles for the working-man and woman
            in obtaining economic freedom. It is the greatest burden to them in all ways. No matter
            how spirited a revolutionary one may feel, or what theories one may hold (it is usually
            the man without a family who holds the most) the cry of hunger, the piteous pinched look
            of several little ones, will compel a man to forego the future good of his class for the
            present urging need of his family. Sentimental, I can hear some of you say. Call it what
            you will, responsibility is based on sentiment, and if you would do away with it, begin
            by reducing the workers' responsibility.</p>
        <p>It is the man with a large family, who is most often the burden in a strike. It is he who
            is the most difficult to bring out on strike; for it is he and his who are the greatest
            sufferers through its duration. One could enumerate various instances where two or three
            groups of workers have broken a strike, and upon looking for the cause you invariably
            found the men in these groups or nationalities have many children, and could not
            withstand their needs. So everywhere, the large family is seen to be one of the
            multitude of miseries which to-day confront the working-class man and woman.</p>
        <p>The Woman Rebel told the working women these things and
            more. It told her the fewer children she had to cook, wash and toil for, the more
            leisure she would have to think, read, and develop. That freedom demands leisure. That
            the first step towards freedom must be in the right of herself over her own body. The
            right to say what she will do with it in marriage and out of it. The right to become a
            mother or not, just as she sees fit to do, and certainly no woman should be made to
            become a mother against her will. These "rights," of course, involve a special
            knowledge--the knowledge of the means to prevent conception; and it was the discussion
            of this subject around which the war on The Woman Rebel
            was waged.</p>
        <p>As Editor and Publisher of The Woman Rebel I felt a glow of
            hope and inspiration in the response which came from the working girls and women all
            over the U.S.A. For fourteen years I have been in the nursing field, and knew too well
            the intolerable conditions among the workers. I saw the women, wives of the workers, ask
            for this knowledge which would keep them from bringing more children into the world, and
            I saw the entire medical profession shake its head in silence at their demand.</p>
        <p>I saw the women of wealth, the masters' wives, obtain the same information with little
            difficulty. </p>
        <p>I saw that if the working-man's wife refused to have more children, she was compelled to
            resort to abortion. It is a rough estimate that over one hundred and fifty thousand
            abortions are performed in U.S.A. each year, and twenty-five thousand deaths occur as
            the result of them. </p>
        <p>I saw that it is the working women who fill this death list, for though the master's wife
            may resort to abortions too, she is given the best care and attention which money can
            buy. A trained nurse is called in attendance, and every care is taken that there shall
            be no evil consequences. The worker's wife, on the other hand, must look for the
            cheapest assistance. The professional abortionist, the filthy midwife, the fake and
            quack, all feed upon her helplessness, and thrive on her ignorance and misery. I saw
            that the Comstock laws produce the abortionist, make him a growing and thriving
            necessity, while the law makers close their Puritan eyes.</p>
        <p>I saw that it is the working-class children who fill the factories, mills, sweatshops,
            orphan asylums, hospitals, reformatories, jails and madhouses, because they have
            preventive knowledge, and can use it, yet continue to pass laws that the worker should
            be deprived of the same. </p>
        <p>I resolved to give my time and efforts to defy the law, not behind a barricade of
            law-books and legal technicalities, but by spreading the information among the workers
            directly in factory and workshop. In order to accomplish this result, I am compelled to
            flee to a place where I could carry out my work unmolested.</p>
        <p>When I have accomplished all that can be gained in this way, I shall return to take up
            the legal end of the case. But ever delighting in the fact, that, being deprived of my
            liberty, or the companionship of those I love, the authorities cannot imprison my
            contempt for their stupidity, nor deprive the workers of the knowledge they have
            received already.</p>
