                Convention of the Federation of Jewish Women's Organizations held
            at the Hotel Astor in New York. It was broadcast on WMCA. Sanger's speech was opened with the following
            announcement: "Margaret Sanger, who is
            recognized as the leader of the birth control movement both in America and abroad, will
            speak today on the subject "Woman and the Future". Mrs.
            Sanger has devoted her life to the cause of womanhood, and the success which she has won
            gives her the right to speak with authority on this topic. Mrs Sanger..."</p><hr>
    
    
    
        <p>Just four years ago the Federation of Jewish Women&#8217;s Organizations at whose annual
            convention I am speaking today, went on record in support of the legalization of birth
            control. It is in great measure due to the active help of this organization and other
            groups of courageous women, such as the National Council of Jewish Women, the
                General Federation of Women&#8217;s Clubs, the Y.W.C.A., that the birth control
            movement is today celebrating a glorious victory and looking forward to the inspiring
            and constructive work which lies ahead.</p>
        <p>We can today with some measure of clarity and hope talk about Woman and the Future. It
            has been a good fight, but a long one.</p>
        <p>In 1873 Congress, urged on by Anthony Comstock, passed the so-called obscenity
            laws, prohibiting the use of the mails and common carriers for items which were
            considered lewd or obscene. The general aim of these laws was perhaps laudable enough.
            But unfortunately articles and information relating to the prevention of conception were
            also classed as obscene. It was made a crime, punishable by $5000 fine or 5 years
            imprisonment or both, for anyone, even a physician, to send contraceptive information or
            supplies through the mails or by common carrier, that is by express. Importation was
            also forbidden.</p>
        <p>The birth control movement has spent years of effort in rectifying this mistake. For with
            the law thus tangled and confused, many doctors hesitated to give birth control advice,
            hospitals and dispensaries which should have been telling women how to space their
            children and plan their families were afraid to do so.</p>
        <p>For the past seven years the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth
                Control, of which I am the president, has been seeking to have this law
            amended. We have found men in Congress brave enough to introduce bills exempting
            physicians from the restrictions of the law in matters relating to contraception. It may
            be hard for you to realize it, but at first it took courage for a member of Congress to
            come out openly for birth control. Hearings were held; the press gave its support; more
            and more men in Congress came to see the right and justice of what we were asking; a
            hundred thousand individuals and a thousand organizations placed themselves on record
            approving of what we were trying to do, and pledging their help.</p>
        <p>A wise and reasonable Court decision in a test case on the importation of birth control
            materials sent to a doctor for research purposes, has given the medical profession what
            we were seeking through Congress. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals
            for the second circuit, in unanimously upholding the decision of the lower court has
            interpreted the Comstock laws, and has defined the rights of the American physician in
            regard to birth control.</p>
        <p>The decision, handed down on November 30, 1936, comes as a result of an informed public
            opinion, as the result of the support of organizations such as this Federation. &#8220;We are satisfied&#8221;, said the judges, &#8220;that this
                statute embraced only such articles as Congress would have denounced as immoral if
                it had understood all the conditions under which they were to be used.&#8221; That is,
            birth control as we understand it today, would not have been included in the statute.&#8220;It&#8217;s design&#8221; the decision continues, &#8220;was not to
                prevent the importation, sale, or carriage by mail of things which might
                intelligently be employed by conscientious and competent physicians for the purpose
                of saving life or promoting the well-being of their patients.&#8221;</p>
        <p>With the tangles and confusions of the past cleared away, we can now look ahead. We can
            envisage what birth control can do for the woman of today and tomorrow.</p>
        <p>For up to now, woman has been a victim of her own powers of reproduction. It has been the
            comparatively few and more fortunate who have known how to have only as many children as
            they could take care of. A small fraction of all women have known how to make motherhood
            a matter of conscious and joyful choice, not a thing of tragedy and chance.</p>
        <p>I will not speak today of what needs to be done in far countries, in
            China, and India, in Japan. Nor will I
            speak of the women of Italy and Germany, who are being
            prodded and cajoled to produce cannon fodder for future wars. Let us think first of
                America.</p>
        <p>Here a new epoch in the birth control movement has begun. Scientific and reliable
            information can now be given to every woman in the land. Every hospital, and there are
            seven thousand of them, every health unit and welfare center, every place which cares
            for the health of women, can now have a physician give birth control advice.</p>
        <p>Last month several hundred physicians, scientists and representatives from birth control
            clinics, met in a two day Conference on Contraceptive Research and Clinical
                Practice. It was no longer necessary to prove the case for birth control. It
            was no longer necessary to talk of belief or disbelief, or of legality, or to bandy
            arguments or opinions. The entire matter had passed from the realm of propaganda to the
            realm of science. These fine men and women came together to confer and interchange their
            knowledge and experiences, so that we might have better methods, better ways of teaching
            women, more knowledge in this field. There was discussion at one interesting session as
            to what a birth control center should be called. Many thought it might better be called
            a mothers Health Center, or a Race Betterment Center, and these terms well describe what
            such a center is. But I confess that I am in favor of the simple phrase birth control.
            As you may know, I coined it more than twenty years ago, and it must have something good
            in it, for it stuck. You will find it in dictionaries and encyclopedias, in scientific
            journals and in newspaper columns. Wherever people speak of bettering the lives of
            women, of bringing forth a better, stronger, happier and healthier race, they speak of
            birth control.</p>
        <p>Emphasis should be placed on the word control. Controlling the size of a family does not
            mean that births should be limited to any arbitrary number. Birth control is not a
            program for the one or two child family. We control our automobiles; we control the heat
            that keeps us warm in winter, and before long so they tell us, we shall be controlling
            the heat that makes us unhappy in summer. We control our time, our appetites, our
            incomes, our lives. It is simple common sense to control the number of children in a
            family, in order that they may be cherished and loved, cared for properly and raised to
            become useful and happy citizens.</p>
        <p>Children should be wanted. They should be conceived in marital love, born of the parents&#8217;
            conscious desire and given the heritage of healthy bodies and sound minds.</p>
        <p>I believe that the bearing and nurture of children are not the aim and end of women&#8217;s
            existence. I want to see the woman of the future liberated, spiritually free, conscious
            of her creative powers. I want to see her using them with vision and intelligence, for
            greater happiness, for security, for peace. To do this, woman must first liberate
            herself. Motherhood must be conscious and voluntary, before it can be creative. Then she
            can make the most of the greatest of all her gifts and responsibilities, the handing on
            of the precious, mysterious gift of life.</p>
        <p>Through birth control women will gain control not only of their bodies, but they will
            develop their souls. Then they will lead the race to heights we can as yet not see.
            Birth control is one of the greatest movements of today and of tomorrow, and what it
            will do for the children, for the women of the future, none of us can yet visualize.</p>
        <p>But we can believe and push on.</p>
