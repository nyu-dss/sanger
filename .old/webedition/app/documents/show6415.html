        <h1>Birth Control.</h1>
        
            <p>A growing awareness by government leaders and the public of the world&#8217;s dangerous
                imbalance between overpopulation and natural resources was becoming apparent in
                1955. (A world population growth of 90,000 a day was estimated by the United Nations
                    department of social affairs.) Attention was focused on the need for
                developing a new, simplified and inexpensive contraceptive method&#8211;one which would be
                acceptable to people of diverse cultural backgrounds. Under the auspices of the Planned Parenthood
                    federation&#8217;s Dickinson Research Memorial fund, medical research pointing toward a
                contraceptive pill or injection made tangible progress during the year. M.C. Chang, research biologist at the
                    Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology under the direction of
                    Gregory Pincus, predicted that
                such a pill might be available to the general public within five years. Chang, who
                received a 1955 Lasker award in
                planned parenthood for outstanding research in animal and human fertility, announced
                that several compounds which worked well on laboratory animals were ready to be
                taken over by physicians for controlled tests on men and women.</p>
            <p>Lasker awards in planned parenthood were also given to Howard C. Taylor of Columbia
                    University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and to Lady Dhanvanthi Rama Rau, founder and president of
                the Family Planning
                    association in India, for their work in the family planning
                field.</p>
        
        
            <h2>International.&#8211;</h2>
            <p>The first international birth control conference ever held in Latin
                    America took place in San Juan,
                    P.R., where the International Planned Parenthood federation&#8217;s western
                hemisphere region held its pioneer conference in May 1955. An appeal was directed to
                the World Health organization to include child-spacing instruction in its
                program of preventive medicine. Resolutions were also sent to the UN Commission on Human
                    Rights and the Inter-American Commission of Women asking that
                the right to space children be recognized as a basic human freedom.</p>
            <p>Another major international family planning meeting was held in 1955 when the
                International Planned Parenthood federation met in Tokyo in October for its fifth world conference
                    on planned parenthood. Delegates from 15 countries in
                    Europe, Asia, Africa,
                    Australia and the Americas, including some of the
                world&#8217;s most eminent scientists in the sex physiology and population fields,
                presented latest findings on world population trends, natural resources, family
                planning methods, marriage guidance and sex education, infertility, abortion and
                sterilization.</p>
            <p>A panel of experts in education, medicine, psychiatry, religion, social work and
                business made an intensive examination of family life patterns at a symposium during
                the American Planned Parenthood federation&#8217;s 35th annual meeting in May. Geared to
                the theme of &#8220;The Family in Pursuit of Happiness,&#8221; panelists traced the growth of
                family life from birth through marriage and parenthood into its relationship with
                community and the world.</p>
        
        
            <h2>U.S. Services.&#8211;</h2>
            <p>The year 1955 also marked the start of a long-range program designed to make the
                services of Planned Parenthood more readily available to all families that need it.
                The new emphasis on reaching more people was conducted with a wider use of
                communications mediums&#8211;literature, radio, TV and motion pictures. A graphic account
                of Planned Parenthood&#8217;s four-point program of birth control, aid to the childless,
                education for marriage and marriage counseling, and research was unfolded in the
                Planned Parenthood federation&#8217;s annual report for 1954 (published in 1955): The
                program was being conducted by the federation and its 110 state leagues and local
                committees in 29 states and the District of
                    Columbia, and had been endorsed by numerous religious bodies and
                prominent clergymen.</p>
            <p>At the Margaret Sanger Research bureau, New York
                    city, physicians and students from medical colleges all over the country
                came to receive instruction in contraceptive techniques. The bureau was the only
                teaching center in the U.S. offering education
                and instruction in all phases of the planned parenthood program.</p>
            <p>Affiliates&#8217; activities were conducted by nearly 4,500 volunteers and 450 employees.
                U.S. birth control clinics numbered 536&#8211;378 of which were in public health clinics,
                hospitals and medicals schools, and 178 were sponsored by Planned Parenthood
                committees&#8211;reaching a total of nearly 250,000 people. Medical assistance to help
                infertile couples was provided by Planned Parenthood in 31 infertility clinics and
                65 referral centers. An additional 119 infertility clinics were located in hospitals
                and medical schools across the country.</p>
