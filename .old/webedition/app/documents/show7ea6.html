		<h1>Birth Control and China and Japan</h1>
		<h3>by Margaret Sanger</h3>
		<p>
        [<em>It</em>]
    is not only in the United States
			
        [<em>that</em>]
     there is need for Birth Control. On the contrary,
			there are countries which need it far more than we do, countries where overcrowding and
			poverty sweep millions of babies out of existence, and where life is a bare struggle for
			existence. Such countries are Japan, and especially China.
			In 1921 students from these countries in the United States came into touch with the
			movement here for Birth Control. Their attention was aroused and their interest
			awakened. Here was something that was desperately needed in their own countries. They
			determined to start a campaign for Birth Control among their own countrymen and
			country-women.</p>
		<p>Due to the arousing of this interest, invitations reached me, towards the close of 1921,
			to go to Japan and deliver lectures on Birth Control. The invitation came from a group
			of progressive thinkers, known as the Kaizo group, and in February, 1922, I
			left New York for San
				Francisco, however, I found that there were difficulties in the way.
			Applying to the Japanese Consul General there
			for a vise to my passport I was surprised to learn that the Japanese Government had issued orders that my passport should not be vised,
			and that I could not lecture on Birth Control in Japan.</p>
		<p>It is not easy to surprise anyone who has worked for long in the Birth Control movement.
			We get accustomed to unexpected obstacles and difficulties. In this case, however, my
			surprise was real; because I was led to believe by Japanese in the United States that
			the interest in the subject of Birth Control was general among the younger members of
			the Government. Then, too, the Kaizo group, with whom I was under agreement to deliver
			five lectures on the subject, publishes a magazine which is highly respected in Japan,
			and as Bertrand Russell had visited Japan under
			the same auspices, I had every reason to believe that the Kaizo group knew the laws of
			their country and were acquainted with the possibilities and limitations under those
			laws.</p>
		<p>In neither of these assumptions was I mistaken. There is a younger group in the Government, and a very
			large group, whose ideas and ideals are broader and higher than those represented by the
			minority, the military party. Many of these more progressive men came to the receptions
			and meetings where I was the guest of honor and expressed their disapproval of the
			government&#8217;s action; their belief in the principle of Birth Control, and their desire to
			help forward the movement in Japan. While these sympathizers can be numbered in the
			hundreds, in special departments they are powerless against the more conservative
			statesmen. </p>
		<p>I was desirous to get at the root of the objection to my presence in Japan; but it was
			not until I reached Yokohama Harbor that I knew
			whether I should be permitted to land or not. While the Taiyo Maru was at
			sea, a vigorous correspondence had gone between the Home
				Office and the Foreign Office of the
			Japanese Government. The Vice Minister of the Foreign Office, Masanao Hanihara, who had attended the Disarmament Conference in Washington, was a fellow traveler on the steamer. He
			interested himself greatly in my mission, and urged by wireless that all courtesy be
			shown me. The final outcome of the negotiations was described by the Japan Times of March 11, 1922. &#8220;Mrs. Sanger,&#8221;
			it stated, &#8220;was allowed to land in this country last night, after a series
				of negotiations that made the diplomacy at the Washington Conference look like
				child&#8217;s play. She will remain here for some time and hopes to have an opportunity of
				discussing with doctors, at least, her theories on Birth Control. But she has
				promised the police that she will &#8216;be good&#8217; and make no attempt to deliver any
				public addresses on the subject</p>
		<p>The following day I called upon the Chief of Police. It
			was amusing to find that everyone from the hall porter to the interpreter knew that I
			was coming. We were ushered into a pleasant room and tea was served, although it was
			only ten o&#8217;clock in the morning. One of the attendants spoke to me about my book &#8220;Woman and the New Race,&#8221; which he said he had read with great
			interest and much pleasure. He then presented me with a Japanese translation, much to my
			surprise, for until I saw it there at the Police
				Office, I had not known that it had been translated or published in Japan.</p>
		<p>The interview lasted about half an hour, and ended by my receiving permission to speak in
			private, or under private auspices on Birth Control. I was told that it was not possible
			to discuss the subject in public meetings, although I might speak publicly on any other
			subject. Before I left the room we were photographed and interviewed by reporters from a
			number of Japanese papers. I never saw anything like the passion of the Japanese press
			for photographs. Everywhere I went I was interviewed and photographed, and at the
			meetings where I spoke there were flashlights--sometimes as many as twenty being taken
			before the meeting started.</p>
		<p>From that day on, there was an address made every day, and some days there were two
			meetings. We found that it was a far better plan to speak to small groups of one or two
			hundred people, where we could discuss the subject freely and frankly, than it would
			have been to have attempted to address large public meetings. Among the groups which
			expressed the greatest interest was the Peers&#8217; Club, organized by Count Cowamura. At no time in my life have I
			given a more intimate address. I can say also that it was received with the finest
			spirit of respect and understanding and desire to know more. it was one of the most
			encouraging events of my stay in Japan. The fact that men of high station came eagerly
			to hear a woman speak is considered by the women here a victorious event in a land where
			the position of women is subordinate and where the men do not seem to take the woman&#8217;s
			movement seriously. </p>
		<p>My lectures were given before the most intelligent people in Japan. The Industrial Organization
			consisted of men at the head of practically every industry in Japan. It gave a dinner in
			my honor, where we sat, Japanese fashion, on the floor, creating an atmosphere conducive
			to conversation. The questions asked by these men indicated much thought on the problem
			of population. </p>
		<p>Perhaps the most enthusiastic meeting that was held was that given in the Imperial
				Hotel at Tokyo on March 20, by a prominent
			commercial organization. Again it was a dinner but not Japanese--&#8220;foreign&#8221; as they term
			it here. Men from the Home Office, Foreign Office and various other Government Departments attended. While many of them
			understood English, it was necessary to have my speech interpreted. This was done
			exceedingly well by Baron Ishimoto, my host
			while in Japan, and I felt that this was the most important and successful meeting held
			while I was there. </p>
		<p>The doctors of Tokyo asked me to give an address on
			practical methods. The interpreter, a young doctor recently returned from United States,
			was not very good, and I felt at a great disadvantage. At Kyoto the medical association
			turned out four hundred strong at a few hours notice, and filled the Congregational Church to its fullest
			capacity. The minister of the church interpreted and did
			it remarkable well, making this meeting a full success. </p>
		<p>All the organizations which invited me to speak were represented by prominent and
			distinguished people. They were all, except the  New Woman&#8217;s
				Organization, composed of the so-called well-to-do. This organization is the
			most advanced and intellectual group of women in Japan. Many of its members are working
			in various trades and industries.</p>
		<p>From Yokohama to Kobe, and again across the inland sea
			to Fuzan, the interest was tremendous and the
			reception accorded me was beyond my hopes or dreams. The opposition of the government
			threw the sympathy of the people with me, and I believe I accomplished more, established
			more centers and aroused more discussion in one month than I could under ordinary
			circumstances have done in a year. Japan now has a Birth Control League. It has for its
			officers four most intelligent men representing four branches of civil life--Medicine,
			Science, Labor and Commerce. It is the general opinion that the agitation is most
			timely. While women were slowly advancing towards their emancipation and Labor was
			taking its first flights, neither had included Birth Control in its programme. Now they
			see their problems in a new light, and they see that by the adoption of Birth Control
			they can cut short their struggles and hasten their victories.</p>
		<p>From Japan I went to the Korea, where I found the people wonderfully alert
			and much interested in the idea of Birth Control. I was not able to stay long there, for
			I was due in China, and the time was short. We in the Western world have
			often asked ourselves how the idea of Birth Control would be accepted in the Orient. Our
			opponents have told us that Japan and China would never practice Birth Control, and that
			if we persisted in our work here the white race would be wiped out. I found, however, on
			the contrary, that the idea of Birth Control is readily accepted both in China and
			Japan, and that there were men and women in both countries ready to go to work to get
			the idea put into practice.</p>
		<p>In Shanghai, I met a number of men connected with
			the press--editors and influential writers in the Chinese world. They entertained me at
			tea, and made plans for the translation and publication of my pamphlet on "Family Limitation," and for the establishment of a magazine
			devoted to the subject of population and Birth Control. In Pekin the Chancellor of the National University took a special interest in my
			mission, and before I left China a Birth Control League had been formed there and was
			ready for active work. </p>
		<p>We cannot go into China with our sympathies and our moral codes, saving her babies from
			infanticide, without increasing her problems. We find that after we have rescued 200
			infants from the river one year, 2000 additional &#8220;sing-song&#8221; girls are in the ranks of
			the prostitutes the next year. In China, we witness the last act in the national tragedy
			of over-population. China, the mysterious fountainhead of art, philosophy, and the
			deepest wisdom of the world, is brought down by the super-abundant breeding of its worst
			elements. Here there are masses of human beings who live below the level of animals.
			They eat, sleep and breed in the crowded streets and sunless alleys. Thousands have not
			even a foothold on the land. They are compelled to live in makeshift boats on the
			crowded banks of the rivers. The flame of Chinese civilization is flickering. It is
			threatened with extinction. There is a rising tide of famine, of wretchedness, of
			disease--a flood which, because of the incessant fertility of those millions, spreads
			like a plague. To contribute to famine funds and to the support of missions in China is
			like trying to sweep back the sea with a broom. But as long as the American public
			prefers sentimentality to science this waste of money, thrown into the bottomless pit of
			charities, with continue. China does not need our missions. The Chinese need our
			sanitation, our hygiene, our Birth Control. (To Be Continued) </p>
