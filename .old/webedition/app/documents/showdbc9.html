        <h1>Family Limitation</h1>
        <h3>By MARGARET SANGER</h3>
        
            
        
        
            <h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
            <p>The need for information concerning birth control is more urgent today among the
                working women of America than it has
                ever been before.</p>
            <p>The world war has awakened us to the realization that governments will continue to
                plunge nations into wars just so long as we, the mothers of men, make life
                cheap.</p>
            <p>It is the big battalions of unwanted babies that make life so hard for the working
                woman and keep her in poverty and stress from generation to generation. Every mother
                feels the wrong that the State imposes upon her when it deprives her of information
                to prevent the bringing into the world of children she cannot feed or clothe or care
                for. She resents this with all the bitterness of her strength and will rejoice to
                find some information contained herein, to help the mothers of America free
                themselves from the burden of too-frequent pregnancies.</p>
            <p>I have tried to give the knowledge of the best French and Dutch physicians translated
                into the simplest English, that all may easily understand.</p>
            <p> There are various and numerous mechanical means of prevention which I have not
                mentioned here, mainly because I have not come into personal contact with those who
                have used them or could recommend them as entirely satisfactory.</p>
            <p>I feel there is sufficient information given here, which, if followed, will prevent a
                woman from becoming pregnant unless she desires to do so.</p>
            <p>If a woman is too indolent to wash and cleanse herself, and the man too selfish to
                consider the consequences of the act, then it will be difficult to find a preventive
                to keep the woman from becoming pregnant.</p>
            <p>Of course, it is troublesome to get up to douche, it is also a nuisance to have to
                trouble about the date of the menstrual period. It seems inartistic and sordid to
                insert a pessary or a suppository in anticipation of the sexual act. But it is far
                more sordid to find yourself several years later burdened down with half a dozen
                unwanted children, helpless, starved, shoddily clothed, dragging at your skirt,
                yourself a dragged out shadow of the woman you once were.</p>
            <p>Don't be over sentimental in this important phase of hygiene. The inevitable fact is
                that unless you prevent the male sperm from entering the womb, you are going to
                become pregnant. Women of the working class, especially wage workers, should not
                have more than two children at most. The average working man can support no more and
                the average working woman can take care of no more in decent fashion. It has been my
                experience that more children are not really wanted, but that the women are
                compelled to have them either from lack of foresight or through ignorance of the
                hygiene of preventing conception.</p>
            <p>It is only the workers who are ignorant of the knowledge of how to prevent bringing
                children into the world to fill jails and hospitals, factories and mills, insane
                asylums and premature graves.</p>
            <p>The working women can use direct action by refusing to supply the market with
                children to be exploited, by refusing to populate the earth with slaves.</p>
            <p>It is also the one most direct method for you working women to help yourself <span class="italics">today</span>.</p>
            <p>Pass on this information to your neighbor and comrade workers. Write out any of the
                following information which you are sure will help her, and pass it along where it
                is needed. Spread this important knowledge!</p>
        
        
            <h2>A NURSE'S ADVICE TO WOMEN.</h2>
            <p>Every woman who is desirous of preventing conception will follow this advice: Don't
                wait to see if you do <span class="italics">not</span> menstruate (monthly sickness)
                but make it your duty to see that you <span class="italics">do</span>.</p>
            <p>If you are due to be "sick" on the eighth of August, do not wait
                until the eighth to see, but begin as early as the fourth to take a good laxative
                for the bowels, and continue this each night until the eighth.</p>
            <p>Women of intelligence who refuse to have children until they are ready for them, keep
                definite track of the date of their menstrual periods. A calendar should be kept, on
                which can be marked the date of the last menstruation, as well as the date when the
                next period should occur.</p>
            <p>Women must learn to know their own bodies, and watch and know definitely how regular
                or irregular they are: if the period comes regularly every twenty-eight days
                (normal) or every thirty days as is in the case of many young girls.</p>
            <p>Mark it accordingly on your private calendar; do not leave it to memory or guess
                work.</p>
            <p>Only ignorance and indifference will cause one to be careless in this most important
                matter.</p>
            <p>If a woman will give herself attention BEFORE the menstrual period arrives, she will
                almost never have any trouble, but if she neglects herself and waits to see if she
                    "comes around," she is likely to have difficulty.</p>
            <p>If a week has elapsed with no signs of the menstrual flow, then it is safe to assume
                conception has taken place.</p>
            <p>Any attempt to interfere with the development of the fertilized ovum is called an
                abortion.</p>
            <p>No one can doubt that there are times where an abortion is justifiable but they will
                become <span class="italics">unnecessary when care is taken to prevent
                    conception</span>.</p>
            <p>This is the <span class="italics">only</span> cure for abortions.</p>
        
        
            <h2>NO SAFE PERIOD.</h2>
            <p>There is current among people an idea that conception can take place only at certain
                times of the month. For instance: ten days after the menstrual period, and four or
                five days before the next period. This is not to be relied upon at all, for it has
                been proven again and again that some women conceive at any time in the month. Do
                not depend upon this belief, for there is no scientific foundation for it. There is
                also the knowledge that nursing after childbirth prevents the return of the
                menstrual flow for several months and conception does not take place. It is well not
                to depend upon this too much, especially after the fifth month, for often a woman
                becomes pregnant again without having "seen anything" or
                without her realizing that she has become pregnant. She thus finds herself with one
                at the breast and another in the womb. Use some preventive.</p>
        
        
            <h2>COITUS INTERRUPTUS.</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the commonest preventive excepting the use of the condom is "coitus
                    interruptus" or withdrawal of the penis from the vagina shortly
                before the ejection of the semen. No one can doubt that this is a perfectly safe
                method; and it is not considered so dangerous to the man as some authorities have
                formerly viewed it, but it requires a man of the strongest willpower to be certain
                that he has withdrawn before any of the semen has been deposited in the vagina. It
                is very difficult to determine exactly whether this has been done. The greatest
                objection to this is the evil effect upon the woman's nervous condition. If she has
                not completed her desire, she is under a highly nervous tension, her whole being is
                perhaps on the verge of satisfaction. She is then left in this dissatisfied state.
                This does her injury. A mutual and satisfied sexual act is of great benefit to the
                average woman, the magnetism of it is health giving. When it is not desired on the
                part of the woman and she has no response,<span class="italics"> it should not take
                    place</span>. This is an act of prostitution and is degrading to the woman's
                finer sensibility, all the marriage certificates on earth to the contrary
                notwithstanding. Withdrawal on the part of the man should be substituted by some
                other means that does not injure the woman.</p>
        
        
            <h2>DOUCHE A CLEANSER -- NOT A PREVENTIVE.</h2>
            <p>Although an antiseptic douche is an important factor in preventing conception, it
                should not be relied upon as a preventive measure in itself. A douche is a cleanser,
                but it is not of itself to be advised as a reliable method to prevent conception.
                When one understands how conception takes place, it can be seen at once that it is
                quite possible for a woman to be in a state of pregnancy before she leaves the bed,
                or before she can reach a douche, unless the womb has been previously covered with
                the rubber pessary, or by the ingredients of a suppository.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, every woman should learn to cleanse herself thoroughly, by means of the
                vaginal douche. Some women object to the use of the suppository because of its
                lubricant effect; this can be modified greatly by the use of a warm salt douche,
                taken just previously to inserting the suppository, cleansing the parts thoroughly
                of any secretions already there.</p>
            <p>Cold water douches are not advised, as there is a tendency to chill and shock the
                nervous system. A warm or moderate douche is advised.</p>
            <p>The use of warm soapsuds as a douche is used by women in France in the
                rural districts; just plain, common soap, as a cleansing douche after the act.</p>
            <p>If you have bathing conveniences, go as quickly as possible to the bath room after
                the sexual act and prepare a douche. Lie down upon the back in the bath tub. Hang
                the filled douche bag high over the tub, and let the water flow freely into the
                vagina, to wash out the male sperm which was deposited during the act.</p>
            <p>Do not be afraid to assist the cleansing by introducing the first finger with the
                tube and washing out the semen from the folds of the membrane. One can soon learn to
                tell by the feeling when it is sufficiently clean. It is said, that the French women
                are the most thorough douchers in the world, which helps greatly in keeping the
                organs in a clean and healthy condition, as well as preventing the male sperm from
                reaching the womb to mate with the ovum.</p>
            <p>When there are no bath room conveniences -- a douche can be taken over the toilet or
                when that is impossible it can be taken over a vessel in a squatting position.</p>
        
        
            <h2>SOLUTIONS FOR DOUCHING.</h2>
            <p>Following are some of the solutions to be used for the douche, which, when carefully
                used will kill the male sperm or prevent its entering the womb:</p>
            <p>Lysol -- is a brown oily liquid which added to water forms a clear soapy
                solution.</p>
            <p>One teaspoonful of lysol to 2 quarts of water (warm) makes a good solution for
                douching. Mix into a pitcher or vessel before placing it in the bag.</p>
            <p>Bichloride -- Get the tablets blue or white from the druggist; the blue are less
                dangerous to have about because of the color. Always mix this solution thoroughly in
                a glass or pitcher before turning it into the bag. Never drop the tablet directly
                into the bag. One tablet to two quarts of water makes a sufficiently strong solution
                for preventive purposes.</p>
            <p>Potassium Permanganate --This also makes a good solution, especially where there is a
                vaginal discharge. The special objection to this is that it stains the skin and
                clothing. This can be purchased in crystal form, and one-half teaspoonful dissolved
                in two quarts of water is the proper strength.</p>
            <p>Salt solution -- Mix four tablespoons of table salt in one quart of warm or cold
                water and dissolve thoroughly. This is good and cheap.</p>
            <p>Vinegar solution -- Many peasants in Europe use vinegar as an antiseptic almost
                exclusively. One glassful to two quarts of water is the strength usually desired.
                Cider vinegar is preferred. Douche afterward with clear water.</p>
            <p>Cold water douche -- This will sometimes remove the semen quite effectively without
                the aid of an antiseptic. But as the semen can hide itself away in the wrinkled
                lining of the vaginal cavity, the cold water will only impede its progress for a
                time. As soon as the warmth of the body revives its activity, the semen continues on
                its journey to meet the ovum.</p>
            <p> Every woman should possess a good two quart rubber douche bag called fountain
                syringe. Hang it high enough to insure a steady direct flow.</p>
            <p>Bulb syringes, such as the whirling spray syringes, have been found satisfactory by
                many women for the purpose of injecting antiseptic solutions. Directions with
                syringe.</p>
            <p>Some women use the douche before the sexual act as a preventive. If this is done, any
                astringent such as boric acid, alum, citric acid, hydrochlorate of quinine used in
                the solution will do. Only a pint of solution is needed for this purpose, following
                the act a larger douche is used as a cleanser. This can also be done with the
                regular antiseptic douche.</p>
        
        
            <h2>THE USE OF THE CONDOM OR "COTS."</h2>
            <p>There is little doubt that a thorough douching of the genital passage with an
                antiseptic solution performed by skilled hands immediately after the sexual act
                would destroy the male sperm, and nothing else would be necessary. But there is
                always the possibility that the sperm has entered the womb before the solution can
                reach it.</p>
            <p>It is safer therefore to prevent the possibility of the contact of the semen and the
                ovum, by the interposition of a wall between them. One of the best is the condom or
                rubber "cot."</p>
            <p>These are made of soft tissues which envelope the male organ (penis) completely and
                serve to catch the semen at the time of the act. In this way the sperm does not
                enter the vagina.</p>
            <p>The condoms are obtainable at all drug stores at various prices. There are some of
                skin gut and some of rubber tissue. These are seamless, thin and elastic and yet
                tough; if properly adjusted will not break. Fear of breaking is the main objection
                to their use. If space has not been allowed for expansion of the penis, at the time
                the semen is expelled, the tissue is likely split and the sperm finds its way into
                the uterus. The woman becomes pregnant without being conscious of it. If on the
                other hand care is given to the adjustment of the condom, not fitting it too close,
                it will act as one of the best protectors against both conception and venereal
                disease. Care must be exercised in withdrawing the penis after the act, not to allow
                the condom to peel off, thereby allowing the semen to pass into the vagina.</p>
            <p>It is desirable to discard the condom after it has been used once. But as this is not
                always done, care must be taken to wash the condom in an antiseptic solution before
                drying it and placing it away for further use.</p>
            <p>The condom is one of the most commonly known preventives in the United States. It has
                another value quite apart from prevention in decreasing the tendency in the male to
                arrive at the climax in the sexual act before the female.</p>
            <p>There are few men and women so perfectly mated that the climax of the act is reached
                together. It is usual for the male to arrive at this stage earlier than the female,
                with the consequence that he is further incapacitated to satisfy her desire for some
                time after. During this time the woman is in a highly nervous condition, and it is
                the opinion of the best medical authorities that a continuous condition of this
                unsatisfied state brings on or causes disease of her generative organs, besides
                giving her a perfect horror and repulsion for the sexual act.</p>
            <p>Thousands of well meaning men ask the advice of physicians as to the cause of the
                sexual coldness and indifference of their wives. Nine times out of ten it is the
                fault of the man, who through ignorance and selfishness and inconsiderateness, has
                satisfied his own desire and promptly gone off to sleep. The woman in self defense
                has learned to protect herself from the long hours of sleepless nights and nervous
                tension by refusing to become interested.</p>
            <p>The condom will often help in this difficulty. There are many girls who have had no
                education on this subject, no idea of the physiology of the act, who upon any
                contact of the semen have a disgust and repulsion, from which it takes some time to
                recover. Much depends upon the education of the girl, but more depends upon the
                attitude of the man toward the relation.</p>
        
        
            <h2>THE PESSARY AND THE SPONGE.</h2>
            <p>Another form of prevention is the pessary (see cut). This is one of the most common
                preventive articles used in France as well as among the women of the middle and
                upper class in America. At one time the cost of these ranged up to seven dollars, as
                they were imported into this country from France. Today they are manufactured in
                this country, and may be had from two dollars up.</p>
            <p>They come in three sizes -- large, medium and small. </p>
            <p>It is well to get the medium size, as the small ones are only for very small boned
                women and easily get out of place.</p>
            <p>In my estimation a well fitted pessary is one of the surest methods of preventing
                conception. I have known hundreds of women who have used it for years with the most
                satisfactory results. The trouble is women are afraid of their own bodies, and are
                of course ignorant of their physical construction. They are silly in thinking the
                pessary can go up too far, or that it could get lost, etc., etc., and therefore
                discard it. It can not only get into the womb, neither can it get lost. The only
                thing it can do is to come out. And even that will give warning by the discomfort of
                the bulky feeling it causes, when it is out of place.</p>
            <p>Before inserting pessary inject into cap a small amount of boric ointment. This will
                act as a cement to help seal the mouth of the womb for the time being and thus
                doubly insures prevention.</p>
            <p>In inserting the pessary it is well to get into a position which will make the
                entrance easy. One foot resting on a low chair opens the parts considerably, also a
                squatting position brings the uterus lower and makes the fitting of the pessary
                easier. Do not use vaseline or oils on rubber, it decays it. Glycerine or soap
                rubbed on its surface makes it smooth enough to slip easily into place.</p>
            <p>After the pessary has been placed into the vagina deeply, it can be fitted well over
                the neck of the womb. One can feel it is fitted by pressing the finger around the
                soft part of the pessary, which should completely cover the mouth of the womb.</p>
            <p>If you do not feel the mouth of the womb through the rubber then the pessary is not
                on right. It should be moved backward a little or forward until the mouth can be
                felt covered. If you still cannot feel it then remove and use some other preventive.
                The uterus may be turned or tipped back so far that a pessary could not reach the
                cervix.</p>
            <p>If it is properly adjusted there will be no discomfort, the man will be unconscious
                that anything is used, and no germ or semen can enter the womb.</p>
            <p>It is not always necessary to take a douche until the following morning, but it is
                always <span class="bold">SAFER</span> to douche immediately after the act. Take part
                or about a quart of an antiseptic douche BEFORE the pessary is removed; after
                removing it continue the douche and cleanse thoroughly.</p>
            <p>Wash the pessary in clear cold water, dry well and place away in the box. One should
                last two years, if cared for.</p>
            <p>I consider the use of the pessary as one of the most convenient, as well as the
                cheapest and the safest method of prevention. Any nurse or doctor will teach one how
                to adjust it; then women can teach each other.</p>
            <p>It is not advisable to wear the pessary all the time.</p>
            <p>Take it out after using, and wear it only when needed.</p>
            <p>A little experience will teach one that to place it is a simple matter.</p>
            <p>There is the so-called "wishbone pessary," recently much in
                favor by physicians. It is made of gold and platinum, or gold and silver. It is
                necessary that it be purchased and inserted by a physician. It can be worn
                constantly; no douching is necessary.</p>
            <p>Better results are obtained when the pessary is removed and cleansed every two or
                three months. A physician must do this also.</p>
        
        
            <h2>SPONGES.</h2>
            <p>Sponges can also be had at the drug store. They have a tape attached to them to be
                conveniently removed. They should be soaked in an antiseptic solution for a few
                minutes before coitus and then introduced into the vagina far up as they can be
                placed. Some physicians have recommended the use of the cotton plug, instead of the
                sponge, to be soaked in a solution of three per cent carbolic and glycerine, before
                the act. The male sperm is destroyed by the weakest solution of carbolic acid. Some
                of the peasants in Europe use the cotton plug soaked in vinegar for
                the same purpose and find it satisfactory. In this country a boric acid solution has
                been used for the same purpose and with satisfactory results. Of course this
                requires a saturated solution, as, for instance, one teaspoonful of the powder to a
                cup of water stirred until dissolved.</p>
            <p>Sponges and plugs can be recommended as perfectly safe, if followed by an antiseptic
                douche before the removal of the plug or sponge, thus preventing the sperm from
                entering the womb. The problem is: to kill the male sperm upon entering the vagina,
                or to wash it out or to kill it directly afterwards. A weak solution of alum may
                also be used for cotton plugs and sponges, <span class="italics">also carbolated
                    vaseline on plugs</span>.</p>
            <p>Get one fully as large as the fist -- boil it for ten minutes. Before using it dip in
                water and vinegar half and half and squeeze out partly, then push it up as far as it
                will go, pack it tight around the mouth of the womb so that it covers completely.
                Douche thoroughly after its removal.</p>
            <p>One of the cheapest methods of birth control is the use of a large sponge.</p>
        
        
            <h2>VAGINAL SUPPOSITORIES</h2>
            <p>Suppositories are becoming more generally used in U.S.A. than any other method of
                prevention.</p>
            <p>These may be found at any reliable pharmacy. The majority of them are made from cocoa
                butter or gelatine, which makes it necessary that they be deposited in the vagina
                several minutes before the act, in order for them to melt. Special ingredients
                negate the effect of the male seed.</p>
            <p>Get your druggist to make up any of the following: <br>Vaginal Suppository<br>Acid
                citric, 6 grains<br>Acid boracic, 1 dram<br>Cocoa butter, 90 grains</p>
            <p>Another suppository found reliable is:<br>Boric acid, 10 grains<br>Salicylic acid,
                2 grains<br>Quinine bisulphate, 3 grains<br>Cocoa butter, 60 grains</p>
            <p>A simple recipe which anybody an easily make is as follows: <br>1 ounce cocoa
                butter<br>60 grains quinine</p>
            <p>Melt the cocoa butter, mix the quinine with it, and form into suppositories by
                letting mixture harden into cake and then cutting it up into ten pieces.</p>
        
        
            <h2>SOME QUESTIONS OFTEN ASKED.</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">1. What is the best preventive?</span>
            </p>
            <p>There is no one preventive to be recommended for everyone in every case. There are
                good and harmless preventives, any one of which can be made safe, according to the
                intelligence applied in using them.</p>
            <p>I would advise the use of a recommended suppository for the first few months in the
                case of a bride, until the parts are in a condition where a pessary may be inserted
                and worn with comfort. Sometimes it is advisable to use suppositories during the
                early months of marriage, using the pessary only after children have been born.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">2. Is a douche necessary after the use of the suppository?</span>
            </p>
            <p>To be certain of good results, I would advise a douche as soon as convenient.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">3. Are any of these methods recommended injurious to the health of
                    the man or woman?</span>
            </p>
            <p>The only method which physicians claim may be injurious to one or both is the
                continued practice of withdrawal. This method is not generally recommended, though
                it is practiced largely in France and England.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">4. Which method is safest?</span>
            </p>
            <p>All are safe if you use care and intelligence in applying them.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">5. Which the least troublesome?</span>
            </p>
            <p>The pessary can be recommended as the least troublesome, as after it is inserted it
                may be left to cover the cervix until the next day.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">6. Is there a safe period?</span>
            </p>
            <p>There is no absolutely safe period between the menstrual periods where intercourse
                can take place without pregnancy occurring, at least not for all women. Some women
                claim this period exists in themselves, but unless you know this positively I would
                not advise a woman to depend upon it.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">7. How soon after menstruation ceases should intercourse
                    occur?</span>
            </p>
            <p>This should be left, as in all cases, to the natural desire of the woman.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">8. Does nursing a baby prevent pregnancy?</span>
            </p>
            <p>It is claimed that pregnancy does not so easily occur during the nursing period,
                especially during the first three or four months. There are many women, however, who
                have conceived, immediately giving birth to another baby eleven months after the
                other. I would not advise depending upon this at all. Use some preventive at once
                and control intelligently the time for the next baby's arrival, instead of leaving
                it to chance.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">9. Does fear of pregnancy affect the child?</span>
            </p>
            <p>Fear affects everything. We do not yet know the effect upon the human race which the
                fear of pregnancy has caused.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">10. Is it harmful to take drugs during the first few weeks after
                    menstruation has stopped?</span>
            </p>
            <p>It is considered especially harmful, not only to the mother, but to the child in
                cases where the drugs have not the desired effect. It stands to reason that a drug
                which is powerful enough to eject the fertilized ovum out of the uterus must have
                power to affect other organs. We often find children wetting the bed up to a late
                age, as well as suffering from other organic weaknesses, which may be traced back to
                the mother's frantic attempt to "come around."</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">11. Should the woman or the man take the precautions?</span>
            </p>
            <p>Either or both, but preferably the woman. The methods to be used by the man --
                withdrawal and the condom -- have their objections for many people. While it is true
                that the employment of either of these methods lessen the trouble for the woman,
                they also deprive her of that great sacred closeness or spiritual union which the
                full play of magnetism gives when not checked by fear, as in withdrawal, or
                interfered with, as in the use of the condom. Some sensitive men object to the use
                of these methods, as also do many women. It is for each couple to decide. Many men
                prefer to use the condom in consideration of the woman, to lessen her trouble in
                douching.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">12. Should a woman have joy in the union?</span>
            </p>
            <p>Yes.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">13. Why does she not?</span>
            </p>
            <p>Either because her mind is occupied with fear of the results, or because of the
                awkwardness and ignorance of the man.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">14. Can this be overcome?</span>
            </p>
            <p>Yes; first, by using a contraceptive which gives confidence so there shall be freedom
                from fear of pregnancy; second, by making the husband understand that a greater love
                and joy is created in the relation when the union is consummated only when the woman
                desires it naturally.</p>
        
        
            <p>I have given in the foregoing pages the most commonly known means of prevention.
                Personally I recommend every poor woman who has had at least one child to use a well
                fitted pessary and learn to adjust it.</p>
            <p>Birth control, or family limitation, has been recommended by some of the leading
                physicians of the United States and Europe. The movement can no longer be set back
                by setting up the false cry of "obscenity." It has already been
                incorporated into the private moral code of millions of the most influential
                families in every civilized country. It will shortly win full acceptation and
                sanction by public morality as well.</p>
            <p>In cases of women suffering from serious ailments, such as Bright's disease, heart
                disease, insanities, melancholia, idiocy, consumption, and syphilis, all a physician
                is allowed to do is to tide these women through their pregnancies if possible. Even
                though the life of the woman is positively endangered, he cannot relieve her without
                calling a colleague in consultation. Therefore, the mortality of mothers suffering
                from these diseases and their infants is very high, and premature births common.</p>
            <p>To conserve the lives of these mothers and to prevent the birth of diseased or
                defective children are factors emphasizing the crying need of a sound and sane
                educational campaign for birth control. </p>
