        <p>The first thing I want to say in relation to my attitude regarding the present War and
            World Peace is that before Hitler came into power in
                Germany I was one of the few Americans who joined the Anti-Nazi
                Committee and gave money, my name and any influence I had with writers and
            others, to combat Hitler's rise to power in Germany.</p>
        <p>
       &#8593;My attitude was open &amp; above board as&#8595;
     my name was on the stationery and
            periodicals and leaflets which were distributed 
       &#8593;by this Comm&#8595;
     over Germany,
                Scandinavia, England, and
                Italy and the United States. </p>
        <p>By every means available this Committee tried to arouse the interest of England's Prime
            Minister and Press, to combat the advance of Nazism. They refused to print the warnings
            or to listen to the facts given until the Jewish bankers in Europe began
            to realize that Nazism was a twin sister to Communism as far as private property was
            concerned. </p>
        <p>When Hitler got into the saddle and burned all books he considered (not immoral) but
            dangerous to the State, my three books were destroyed and have not been allowed to
            circulate in Germany. The publisher and translator were put into concentration camps and
            I have never heard of them since. </p>
        <p>As soon as Hitler began his tirade against the Democracies, the Anti-Nazi Committee went
            underground and added to its program--"Anti-War and Anti-Nazi." This valiant little band
            of workers have endangered their lives again and again by daring to give out facts to
            the Press outside of Germany, but are constantly adding to their numbers in secret.
            Almost daily members of the original group must escape into other countries in order to
            avoid death and torture. It will be because of the work of this group any revolution in
            Germany must come. While I do not, and cannot, communicate directly with this
            underground group of valiant workers I hear in various ways and thru methods their
            activities, and continue to send contributions to help their work. </p>
        <p>In the very earliest days of Hitler's power it was the women and men in the liberal and
            advanced thinking movements of which many were my friends whose work was destroyed,
            homes confiscated, they themselves either escaped, were put into concentration camps or
            met death. Women doctors at one time in the highest positions of medical science are
            today unknown and no one can account for what has happened to them. Germany has put the
            clock back 
       &#8593;100 years&#8595;
     for the women of Germany and perhaps to a certain extent
            for the women of Europe.</p>
        <p>These brief facts I set forth to say at the outset that what I say later is not based on
            my sympathy or approval of Nazi Germany. </p>
        <p>Anyone who has watched the results of the last War, the World War, and the Peace of
                Versailles, must realize that war is not the
            best or even 
       &#8593;most&#8595;
     strategic method of attaining the best results for our
            civilization. Year by year since 1918 there kept arising a conflict of national
            interests based upon entirely different ideals--(England and France viz.
            Germany, Italy, and Russia) interests that unless firmly defined and
            promptly dealt with by England and France were bound to result in another war--doubtless
            a World War. But Neville Chamberlain who was
            the spokesman for the Democracies and into whose hands we of the Western world trusted
            our Fate and future played, flirted, caressed and catered to the whims of Italy, and
            Germany, which they in turn (like the experienced prostitute cajoling an old, rich, fat,
            client) kept asking for more and more and still more until the turning point in
            September 1938 when Mr. Chamberlain surrendered the Peace of Europe and condemned the
            Democracies to War or oblivion. From the time that Chamberlain visited Hitler it was not
            possible to arrest the advance of Nazism by peaceful or diplomatic means because he is
            not the man to cope with Nazism or Fascism as he was caught in the net of their weaving
            "Anti-Communism." </p>
        <p>England has noble traditions but by no means can we trust the future of our civilization
            to her diplomats. She has broken pledges which she must explain--Versailles 1916, Manchuria 1931. The pledges of her diplomats and
            statesmen like Balfour  to
                Palestine, Simon and
                Manchuria--Hoare as well as Leval for France and their promises to Italy for her
            part in the war in 1915. </p>
        <p>Then the promises of Great Britain to India, as well as the
            war debts to United States of America, I have not
            mentioned and I try to forget Great Britain's policy of non-intervention in
                Spain while she allowed Hitler and Mussolini to crush Republic Spain, the only country on earth today who has
            stood up with every man, woman and child to the brutal advance of Nazi and Fascist
            Europe.</p>
        <p>The above is but a brief outline of the high spots no intelligent thinking person can
            forget. Perhaps were I in close touch with those who can explain the policy of Great
            Britain regarding these historical events I might be moved to say "Amen," but for the
            present I can only say I do not believe that the statesmen of England or France are any
            more righteous, noble honest, truthful or wise than the same gamesters in Germany, Italy
            or Russia. They are all playing a game with Nations as their pawns. I refuse to be
            pro-British, or pro-France, as I refuse to be pro-German or pro-Russian, or
            pro-anything, but a thinking, reasoning, human being whose nation is the World, and
            whose religion is Humanity. </p>
        <p>We set apart and give power to a set of men called to represent a Nation. They are
            supposed to have greater ability and knowledge of international affairs than most of us,
            and it is to these men whom we trust to safeguard our liberties, independence and our
            National welfare. When these men or any set of men fail to live up to the trust imposed
            in them and ruthlessly plunge their own nation into war, regardless of warnings, then it
            seems to me such men or group of men should resign their positions over to others more
            representative of the peoples ideals. </p>
        <p>I firmly believe that Europe will not have a just Peace until Germany gets rid of Hitler,
            but also shall Italy, England and France get rid of their own leaders whom History will
            certainly identify as War Lords.</p>
