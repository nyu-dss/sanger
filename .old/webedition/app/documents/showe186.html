        <h1>PORTET AND FERRER.</h1>
        <p>Lorenzo Portet was born in 1870, at Vich,
                Spain, about 18 miles from Barcelona.
            He was an only child. His father and mother were both Catalans, though his grandfather
            was a Frenchman. His father was a farmer, and although nothing of a radical--as we know
            the term today--he was nevertheless advanced enough to aspire to obtain for his son,
            Lorenzo, a University education. He accordingly sent Lorenzo to Barcelona at the age of
            seventeen to enter the University there, in the hopes that he would become a barrister. </p>
        <p>After three years study of law at the University, Lorenzo became disgusted with
                Spain and Europe in general. He had been associated in
            the meantime with the Catalan movement (which is similar in feeling to the Irish
            movement in Great Britain) and the further he advanced in ideas for
            Catalan freedom, the more certain he became of the reactionary ideas of the leaders of
            the movement. He consequently left Spain for South America where he
            remained for five years teaching at schools in Buenos Aires and helping in revolutionary journalistic work.</p>
        <p>In 1895, he returned to Spain where he found both parents had died during his absence. He
            had, during this time, developed newer and more revolutionary ideas, and threw himself
            in the movement in Spain for the freedom of Cuba.</p>
        <p>This was about the time of the Cuban insurrection when the Cubans took up arms against
            the Spanish Government. A strong movement in Spain had grown up in its favor
            mainly composed of anarchists and republicans; who had formed groups and issued
            manifestos protesting against Spanish domination, etc. Then occurred the tragedy of the
            Corpus Christi procession (1896) where three bombs were thrown at the Bishops and high
            priests, and, as usual, hundreds of arrests followed.</p>
        <p>The authorities in Spain at such a time arrest as they slaughter--in wholesale. Over
            three hundred arrests occurred in a few days. Everyone who had advanced ideas, radicals,
            republicans, free-thinkers, or any one even seen connected with these, was thrown into
            jail. Portet with several friends escaped across the frontier into France
            to await results.</p>
        <p>It was at this time in Paris that he first met Francisco Ferrer, who had also previously become
            disgusted with Spain and had made his home in Paris. Word now came to Paris from those
            who had been arrested that tortures were being inflicted on several of the prisoners in
            Montjuich; that on August 4th, the anniversary of the inquisition, the tortures were
            applied and the prisoners were at the mercy of the torturers. Every cruelty was applied
            to compel the prisoners to "confess" their plots in the Corpus Christi procession.
            Finger and toe nails were pulled out, burning and singeing the sex organs, nothing was
            given the prisoners to eat, except dried salted cod-fish; then water was placed within
            sight, but out of reach, until the tortured ones fell from exhaustion.</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister of Spain during this time was Sr. Antonia Canovas del Caserello. Eight
            of the Civil guard, well drilled in the art of
            refined torturing, were those selected to apply these cruelties, but one of the eight
            happened to be a Freemason and one of the men about to be tortured was also a Freemason
                (Gana). The Civil Guard, who was a Mason,
            refused to apply the tortures, but was kept a prisoner in Montjuich until all was over.</p>
        <p>When word came to Paris that the authorities were torturing the prisoners, Portet left at
            once and returned to Barcelona to try to get into communication with some comrades in
            Montjuich. He succeeded. Names were sent of those who were being tortured and those who
            were applying them, through the Freemason. With this information and the proofs, Portet
            returned to Paris to present these facts to the public.</p>
        <p>The French press flamed red with indignation at the outrages, and connected the Cuban
            rebellion with the injustice of the Spanish authorities as demonstrated at Montjuich.
                G. Clemenceau was then editor of La Justice, and Malato
            was assistant editor of L'Intransigeant, with  Angiollilo as assistant of staff.
            Both of these papers led in the publicity against this second inquisition, and large
            public meetings were held in protest in Paris, which resulted in a large demonstration
            before the Spanish Embassy, where the people
            stoned the house, breaking in doors and windows, and were indignant and furious enough
            to demolish the whole place.</p>
        <p>The police charged the crowd and thereby saved the Ambassador and all other Spanish
            authorities in France from rough treatment.</p>
        <p>The next day Portet was arrested. He had been followed about by detectives since his
            return from Barcelona with proofs of the tortures. He was now expelled from France and
            came to England.</p>
        <p>This act of expulsion on the part of the French government might have settled for some
            time the activities of a person less fearless than Portet. But we find him ten days
            after leaving France again passing through on his way to Madrid. He continued to pass to and fro from England to Barcelona for
            years, and it was only a few years ago that the official permit was granted him to enter
            France. On May 4th five of the tortured prisoners were shot to death at Montjuich. One
            young chap named Mas, who went insane from torture,
            was among these shot by the authorities, and prisoners described his mad songs and
            laughter on the way to his death. </p>
        <p>Great was the agitation throughout Europe at the shooting of these prisoners--protests,
            indignation--nothing seemed to put to shame the Spanish authorities for their outrageous
            and barbarous conduct. Nothing seemed to stop their cruelties. All propaganda in Spain
            was suppressed; all papers confiscated; the hands of the Spanish radicals were tied and
            their voices stilled. All propaganda had to be carried on in England, France,
                Italy and Belgium. The Spanish government did not
            disturb itself with indignation outside its border. Not until the Prime Minister Canovas
            was shot to death by the young idealist Angiolillo did Spain cease to inflict punishment
            on innocent victims. It was just one year after, almost to the day of the anniversary of
            the tortures, on August 4th, that Angiolillo, residing at the same hotel, and sitting at
            the same table with Canovas, avenged the death and torture of his comrades at
            Montjuich.</p>
        <p>A few weeks after Canovas's death, twenty-eight of the prisoners who had been sentenced
            to death had their sentence commuted and instead were committed to long terms of
            imprisonment, (all since allowed freedom) while all the others were set at liberty,
            though many were expelled from Spain; among these were Anselmo Lorenzo and Tarrida del
                Marmol, also Montseny.
            Many of prisoners died after they were released, while many others went insane.
            Angiolillo gave his life to avenge his comrades. The last word spoken by him was "Germinal". </p>
        <p>When Portet first met Ferrer in Paris in 1896, Ferrer was an enthusiastic republican. He
            had been connected with the republican movement in Spain, which aimed to overthrow the
            monarchy and to establish a Republic as in France. Through the Cuban rebellion and the
            fact that many of the Spanish troops had rebelled against being sent to shoot down the
            Cuban rebels, Ferrer and Portet worked together in the South of France where hundreds of
            soldiers had deserted the Spanish Army and crossed over into France. This
            little army waited for the psychological moment, when something should occur, so that
            with flags and banners flying they could march into Spain and declare the republic. That
            moment never came. Alas! The spirit was there and the daring and the courage, but the
            financial backing for food and shoes and other necessities for their numbers were of
            lacking. So nothing happened.</p>
        <p>At this time Ferrer was not only a republican, but a free-thinker, (which means
            anti-religious) he was also Freemason. He had almost no ideas of anarchy or of anarchist
            ideals. He became interested in this subject with his friendship and admiration for
            Portet. He began to read and subscribe to more advanced literature, and became convinced
            that education of a <span class="italics">new kind</span> was the key to the social
            problem, and gradually developed the ideas of the Modern School. He had been
            teaching Spanish in Paris and had for his pupil a Madame Meunier, who, though a Roman Catholic, became
            interested in Ferrer's ideas and promised him enough money during her life-time to
            establish the Modern School in Spain. We all know that only through this means was
            Ferrer able to attempt to develop his ideal, and on her death she left him enough to
            continue the work. All was given him unconditionally, to be used for the work he wished
            to do. Ferrer returned to Barcelona to carry out his project. His first work was to
            convince the workers of the need of new schools. He opened the Modern School, at the
            same time assisting those who already had independent schools which accepted the ideas
            of the Modern School by donating books, payment of rents, teachers' salaries, etc.,
            which helped many of them to get a solid footing and a much deeper interest in
            Education. His idea was to teach the child life through nature, to analyse religions,
            governments, etc., and to reject that which could not be reasoned. There were at the
            time Ferrer established the Modern School several other kinds of independent school.
            There were the "secular" or lay-schools, which were considered advanced before the
            Modern Schools were established; these differ from the government schools <span class="italics">only</span> in that they are <span class="italics">anti-clerical</span>. There were also "Neutral Schools", where religion was neither
            defended nor attacked; but none of these was sufficient for Ferrer, who believed that so
            long as the Church and Government exist as a power, they should be attacked, exposed and
            abolished.</p>
        <p>The Rationalist Schools sprang from the Modern School of Spain and are
            synonymous with Modern Schools. Ferrer created a new idea in education in Spain of
            anti-church, anti-capitalism, anti-patriotism, anti-militarism, and combined these
            teachings in the Modern School for the promotion of universal peace through economic
            justice. In the year 1901 Ferrer opened the Modern School in Barcelona. He had the
            cooperation of many of the most eminent educators in Europe.</p>
        <p>Two prominent professors from the University of Barcelona lectured at the
            Modern School on Sunday evenings for the benefit of students and parents. One professor
            of Medicine, Martinez Vargas, wrote text-books
            for the school, principally on hygiene; while Professor Odon
                de Buen lectured and wrote several books on science. The schools were not
            considered anarchistic at the time, and not until a year later was there much criticism
            of them.</p>
        <p>Attention was directed to Ferrer's schools by what seems to me a laughable thing, but it
            shows how a small incident may arouse intense interest.</p>
