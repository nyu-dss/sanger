        <h1>What Every Girl Should Know</h1>
        <h3>By Margaret H. Sanger.</h3>
        <h2>Introduction.</h2>
        <p>Students of vice, whether teachers, clergymen, social workers or physicians, have been
            laboring for years to find the cause and cure for vice, and especially for prostitution.
            They have failed so far to agree on either the cause or the cure, but it is interesting
            to know that upon one point they have been compelled to agree and that is that IGNORANCE
            OF THE SEX FUNCTIONS is one of the strongest forces that sends young girls into unclean
            living. </p>
        <p>This, together with the knowledge of the rapidly increasing spread of venereal diseases
            and the realization of their subtle nature, has awakened us to the need of a saner and
            healthier attitude on the sex subject, and to the importance of SEX EDUCATION for boys
            and girls.</p>
        <p>This need has shown itself so clearly that the question no longer seems to be, "Is there
            need of instruction?" but, "Who shall instruct?" Shall the mother or teacher instruct?
            When shall such instruction be given? In childhood, or in puberty? These are the points
            now under discussion. </p>
        <p>To the writer the answer is simple. The mother is the logical person to teach the child
            as soon as questions arise, for it is to the mother that the child goes for information
            before he enters the schoolroom. If, therefore, the mother answers his questions
            truthfully and simply and satisfies his curiosity, she will find that the subject of sex
            ceases to be an isolated subject, and becomes a natural part of the child's general
            learning. A woman does not need to be a college graduate, with a special degree in the
            study of botany, before she can tell her child the beautiful truth of its birth. But she
            does need to clear her own mind of prudishness, and to understand that the procreative
            act is natural, clean and healthful; that all nature is beatified through it, and
            consequently that it is devoid of offensiveness.</p>
        <p>If the mother can impress the child with the beauty and wonder and sacredness of the sex
            functions, she has taught it the first lesson, and the teacher can elaborate on those
            teachings as the child advances in school. All schools should teach the anatomy of the
            sex organs and their physiology, instead of teaching the human body in the neuter gender
            as has been done up to this time. </p>
        <p>The whole object of teaching the child about reproduction through evolution is to clear
            its mind of any shame or mystery concerning its birth, and to impress it with the
            beauty, naturalness of procreation, in order to prepare it for the knowledge of puberty
            and marriage.</p>
        <p>There must of necessity be special information for the pubescent boy and girl, for having
            arrived at the stage in their mental development they no longer take for granted what
            has been told of them by the parents, but are keen to form their own ideas and gather
            information independently. It is right, therefore, to give them the facts as science has
            found them. </p>
        <p>There are workers and philanthropists who say there is too much stress put upon the
            subject of venereal diseases; that the young girl after learning or hearing of the
            dangers she is likely to encounter in the sexual relation, is afraid to marry and
            consequently lives a life unloved and alone. </p>
        <p>"Your treatment of this subject is dangerous," said a very earnest
            social worker a few weeks ago. "Such knowledge will prevent our young girls
                from marrying."</p>
        <p>To which I replied that my object in telling young girls the truth is for the definite
            purpose of preventing them from entering into sexual relations whether in marriage or
            out of it, without thinking and knowing. Better a thousand times to live alone and
            unloved than to be tied to a man who has robbed her of health or of the joy of
            motherhood, or welcoming the pains of motherhood, live in anxiety lest her sickly
            offspring be taken out of her life or grow up a chronic invalid. </p>
        <p>I have more faith in the force of love. I believe that two people convinced that they
            love each other and desire to live together in marriage will talk as frankly of their
            own health and natures as they do today of house furnishings and salaries. Their love
            for each other will protect them from ill-health and disease, and prompt them to procure
            of their own accord a certificate of health if each has the right information and
            knowledge.</p>
        <p>There are, however, different phases of nature other than venereal disease, the knowledge
            of which binds and cements the love of two people. These are symptoms of a great social
            disorder.</p>
        <p>Every girl should first understand herself: she should know her anatomy, including sex
            anatomy: she should know the epochs of a normal woman's life, and the unfoldment which
            each epoch brings: she should know the effect the emotions have on her acts, and finally
            she should know the fullness and richness of life when crowned by the flower of
            motherhood. </p>
        <p>This knowledge I shall endeavor to give in the following articles. Fragmentary the
            articles must of necessity be, for there are volumes written on each subject. </p>
        <p>I shall try to free the subjects from technicalities and give the opinions of writers who
            have made those subjects their life studies and also the facts as I myself have learned
            them.</p>
        <p>It is not my intention to thrust upon any one a special code of morals, or to inflict
            upon the reader of this page my own ideals of morality. I only presume to present the
            facts for you to accept according to your understanding.</p>
        <p>The first article will deal with the girl during the age when sex first manifests itself,
            in that most fascination, interesting and puzzling period of a woman's life--the budding
            period, called girlhood.</p>
