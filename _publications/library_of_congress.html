<div class="maintext">Margaret Sanger gave a massive collection of her papers to the Library of Congress, which were microfilmed on 145 reels in 1977 by the Library. These
papers cover the years 1900-1966, but the major part of the collection is concentrated between 1928-1940. The collection includes personal and family correspondence,
correspondence with international birth control leaders, and the voluminous records of the National Committee for Federal Legislation on Birth Control
Records of the American Birth Control League, the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, and other organizations, as well as many Sanger speeches and articles. The
Library of Congress did not microfilm the entire collection--there are some scrapbooks, clippings files and other materials which can only be used in the
Library of Congress's Manuscript Reading Room.</p>
