        <h1>ONE WEEK'S ACTIVITY IN ENGLAND</h1>
        
            <p>Inspiring reports come to us from England indicating that Birth
                Control is now accepted, not merely by a small group, but by men and organizations
                exerting powerful influence, as a national problem to be faced and solved by the
                English people as a whole. The record of one week's activity, for instance, is most
                encouraging, illustrating as it does that the tireless and often unrewarded
                activities of our British comrades have been productive of the most fertile results.
                Birth Control has entered the national consciousness of England. The little seeds of
                thought sown by the Neo-Malthusians and Birth Control advocates have not fallen on
                sterile ground. The one week we speak of was the first in June. Let us summarize
                that crowded week of Birth Control activity:</p>
        
        
            <h2>I. At the Congress on Public Health</h2>
            <p>The Congress of the Royal Institute of Public Health met in Brighton. One session was devoted to the
                question of Birth Control. The chair was taken by Mrs. Cooper Rawson, who in her opening speech urged the limitation of
                offspring, not alone on the ground of the danger to the nation but in the name of
                humanity. Our friend, Dr. Norman Haire
                developed this point of view in his quietly effective manner. But the supreme event
                of this Congress on Public Health was the sermon delivered to the delegates in the
                Brighton Parish Church by the Bishop of Birmingham (Dr. E. W. Barnes). I say supreme because this sermon, so outspokenly
                courageous, provoked a response from the Vicar of Brighton (Canon F. C. D. Hicks), expressing disagreement with the
                Bishop, and this incident stimulated a widespread and healthy discussion in the
                press. It evoked, especially from Harold Cox and
                    Alexander M. Thompson ("Dangle" of the Sunday Chronicle), eloquent and readable defences of the doctrine of
                Birth Control.</p>
            <p>If space permitted, we would reprint for the benefit of our readers all of these
                splendid utterances. We shall content ourselves with quoting on another page of the
                    REVIEW* a bit of Bishop Barnes' sermon, expressing
                with a fine sense of the ethics of Christ, the profound morality of contraception.
                Let us hope that the courageous example of Bishop Barnes may inspire influential
                American churchmen to similar unequivocal utterance on the subject of Birth
                Control.</p>
        
        
            <h2>II. National Council of Public Morals</h2>
            <p>Another event which stimulated discussion and nation-wide publicity was the report,
                (published on June second, the Tuesday following Bishop Barnes' sermon) of the
                special committee appointed by the National Council of Public Morals.
                Lord Dawson  of Penn had submitted a
                report advocating its endorsement of contraception. After declaring that "conception
                control" demands a much fuller investigation from the medical, economic and
                religious standpoints, the committee came to the amazingly sterile conclusion that
                    "the ideal method of Birth Control is self-control." "Such self-control must be agreed upon by the husband and wife and
                    carried out in a spirit of service and sacrifice.... The line of real advance
                    lies in a deeper reverence, a return to a greater simplicity of life, and, not
                    least, a drastic reformation of our social and economic conditions." </p>
            <p>The value of our movement is not in the report of this committee, but the replies it
                has stimulated by its impossibly stilted and absurdly fantastical conception of
                ordinary human nature. "While they wait a hundred years or so for
                    that reformation," exclaimed Alexander Thompson, hitting "the nail on the
                head" in the Sunday Chronicle, "husband
                    and wife... are to model themselves on St. Francis of Assisi, and practise self-control in the spirit of
                    service and sacrifice! Imagine it.... If you think for one little moment of the
                    conditions under which conjugal relations are conducted in the 
	[<em>word missing </em>]
	 sties of our big cities, you will realize that one
                    might as well hope to grow roses from the thistle down or teach the earthworm to
                    sing like the nightingale. My word! Think of it. Continence, chastity, service,
                    sacrifice, as the text of a heart-to-heart chat with Bill Sikes!"</p>
        
        
            <h2>III. National Conference of Labor Women</h2>
            <p>Birth Control caused stormy scenes at the National Conference of Labor
                    Women in Birmingham, held at the
                same time as the Brighton Congress on public health. A resolution had been
                introduced to the effect that physicians in public service should be permitted to
                give contraceptive information to married people who requested it. Miss Quinn, a Catholic delegate from Leeds, protested against Birth Control being taken
                up by the Socialist movement. "I represent thousands of working
                    women... to whom this doctrine and this insidious propaganda spells impurity. I
                    protest with all the vehemence I possess against the suggestion that working
                    women want instructions in impure and unchaste methods. It is a crime against
                    God and humanity!" </p>
            <p>It is reported that this speech provoked great dissension, and Miss Ellen
                    Wilkinson, M.P., the chairman, interposed that she had allowed Miss
                Quinn a good deal of latitude, but she would not allow her to insult the rest of the
                delegates. "I represent the sentiments of thousands of Catholic
                    women," retorted Miss Quinn. Other women might hold different views, quite
                honestly, replied the chairman, and Miss Quinn should not impute impure motives to
                them. Bravo, Ellen Wilkinson, M.P.! </p>
        
        
            <h2>IV. Quakers Approve of Birth Control</h2>
            <p>This active week closed with another significant event&#8211;the publication by a committee
                of the Society of Friends of a pamphlet entitled "Marriage and Parenthood&#8211;the Problem of Birth Control." While this
                pamphlet does not bind the Society of Friends as a unity to our doctrine, it may be
                said to represent the enlightened attitude of the English society. </p>
            <p>"There can be no doubt that Friends, like others, have accepted the
                    idea of the small family," assert the signatories of this pamphlet. "There must be many young couples who long to have children and yet
                    have no margin to meet the incidental cost of child-birth." Further: "The method of complete abstinence does not seem to us to be
                    necessarily right for most married people. To lay down as a standard for all
                    married people a rule of life that can only be attained by a few is in itself an
                    error in moral direction."</p>
            <p>This expression is significant, indicating as it does without confusing the issue
                that the Society of Friends is brave enough, as all other Protestant bodies should
                be, to announce publicly its independence from the domination of the Roman
                    Catholic Church in this all-important problem, in that it refuses to rule
                out the discussion and the spread of knowledge concerning Birth Control.</p>
            <p>These four important incidents, coming almost within the compass of seven days, give
                some indication of the widespread and intense interest our British cousins are
                taking in Birth Control. May it inspire all of us to renew our activities to keep
                our own country abreast in the march toward the new civilization!</p>
