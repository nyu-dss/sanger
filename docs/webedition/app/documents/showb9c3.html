		<p>MISS MORGAN
			
       &#8593;or Chairman&#8595;
    </p>
		<p> FRIENDS:</p>
		<p> My heart is too full to express my gratitude in words.</p>
		<p> I have bene sitting here listening to all these beautiful tributes, but I have had to
			ask myself: &#8220;IS THIS ONLY A DREAM OR AM I REALLY AWAKE?&#8221;</p>
		<p> After nearly twenty years of INDICTMENTS, SUPPRESSIONS, PATROL WAGONS, RAIDS, COURTS,
			JAILS, <span class="del">PERSECUTION and RIDICULE</span>, it is hard to believe that I would receive
			any <span class="underlined">reward</span>
			<span class="del">beside</span>
			
       &#8593;except&#8595;
     a <span class="underlined">warrant</span>!</p>
		<p>
			<span class="del">As I press this medal in my hand,</span>
			
       &#8593;I shall always prize this medal&#8595;
     it seems to me <span class="underlined">much
				more</span> than a reward. It is <span class="underlined">your</span> action-- <span class="underlined">your GESTURE</span>-- that I value 
       &#8593;so&#8595;
     much <span class="del">more
				than the recognition of <span class="underlined">my</span> efforts.</span>
			
       &#8593;because it&#8595;
     symbolizes <span class="del">the</span>
			<span class="underlined">public</span> recognition by a <span class="underlined">representative</span> group of <span class="del">the</span>
			<span class="underlined">enlightened women</span> of <span class="del">America</span>
			
       &#8593;this country&#8595;
     of the basic importance of Birth Control as a necessary
			instrument in the making of our civilization.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="del">You are </span>In expressing <span class="underlined">your</span> belief in <span class="underlined">me</span>, and in 
       &#8593;you are joining the battle for&#8595;
     Birth
			Control. That is the important thing! This medal will go with me into the thick of the
			fight! In moments of fatigue or discouragement, it will reassure me, whisper to me: &#8220;You
			are not alone in this fight. Intelligent and courageous women are standing behind you,
			standing with you in spirit!&#8221;</p>
		<p> I am just back from five months on the firing line in Washington, five months,--if I dare say so without disrespect--in the
			Congressional trenches; five months at the head of a valiant little band of shock
			troops, trying to get a bill through Congress which will enable women of America to have
			free access to scientific knowledge of their own bodies.</p>
		<p> These last, busy, hectic five months have taught me one thing: <span class="underlined">beliefs</span>, <span class="underlined">convictions</span>, <span class="underlined">ideas</span> mean nothing unless they are brought out into the open, enunciated
			boldly, expressed challengingly, and courageously. Passive acceptance is not enough. It
			is just as unhealthy to hoard an idea as to hoard dollars--much more so, in fact. Put
			your <span class="del">ideals</span>
			
       &#8593;connections&#8595;
     into circulation, or they wither and die.</p>
		<p> Just as the organs of our bodys atrophy if not exercised, so our belief in <span class="del">
	[<em>one word illegible</em>]
	</span>
			
       &#8593;an&#8595;
     idea must be <span class="underlined">actively</span> expressed, if it is
			to mean anything to ourselves of the world. If you are ashamed of your belief, if you
			are afraid to express it in public-- it will fester and rot and die miserably 
       &#8593;--
				and so will your spirit!&#8595;
    </p>
		<p> In presenting this medal to me, who less than twenty years ago was denounced and
			indicted and run out of this great free enlightened country as a representative of the
				<span class="underlined">devil</span> himself, you are acting with courage and
			independence. You are championing a cause that is still unpopular, that is still
			denounced and blocked at every step by its bitter and fanatical enemies.</p>
		<p> I am not EXAGGERATING.</p>
		<p> While the intelligent and enlightened elements in this country content themselves with
			remarking casually: &#8220;Of course I&#8217;m for Birth Control-- everybody is!&#8221; our opponents are
			ACTIVE in blocking our every move, Dont think for a moment that their opposition is a
				<span class="underlined">Passive</span> one.</p>
		<p> Let me tell you something of our fight in WASHINGTON.</p>
		<p> We arrive there to find the very air surcharged with the great problems of the day: WAR
			DEBTS, MORATORIUMS, REPARATIONS, UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF, THE PEACE CONFERENCE, THE WAR IN
				MANCHURIA AND CHINA: NEW TARIFF WALLS: SALES TAXES, SOAKING THE RICH, THE BUDGET TO BE
			BALANCED, BEER AND PROHIBITION.</p>
		<p> The mind of each Representative, each Senator, was alike a busy telephone switch
				
       &#8593;board&#8595;
     with his or her secretary the telephone operator. All the wires are
			busy. How to PLUG in with a subject like BIRTH CONTROL-- To the busy legislator, it
			comes like a message from Mars or some <span class="del">
	[<em>one word illegible</em>]
	</span> planet even more remote.</p>
		<p> One morning I called upon forty Congressmen and succeeded in obtaining interviews with
			only TWO of them. 
       &#8593;But that was a good day&#8217;s work.&#8595;
     But in the past. five
			months, we have interviewed no less than TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY representatives and
			FORTY-FIVE Senators. These gentlemen for the most part expressive a POLITE, PASSIVE
			Sympathy. But they are dominated by Fear--fear of their constituents, fear of public
			opinion, fear of prejudice, fear most of all of the opponents of Birth Control. For
			these opponents are skilled in the tactics of blocking all progress. They may
			be--undoubtedly they are--in a minority. But by the TIRELESS ACTIVITY, they give the
			impression of being twice as strong as they actually are. While the adherents of BIRTH
			CONTROL may on occasion come to our aid, the OPPONENTS spring into double and intense
			activity, knowing that they must exercise eternal vigilance to prevent the freedom of
			women.</p>
		<p> One Senator finally confessed: &#8220;If I sponsor
				this bill, I&#8217;LL MAKE ENEMIES: if I do not sponsor it, it will make no difference to
				my popularity.&#8221; Thus, though the PASSIVE supporters of Birth Control measures
			may be actually more numerous, they never protest against this type of refusal. They
			acquiesce; they forget at the next election. We can stir them into sporadic activity;
			but <span class="del">they</span>
			
       &#8593;their&#8595;
     attention, is easily distracted, and led astray by other problems which
			seem on the surface more pressing, but actually are not so.</p>
		<p> We were told by our political advisors--we women are of so trusting a nature--that our
			Bill would come before the Judiciary
				Committee. We spent months interviewing, persuading, educating the twenty-five
			members of that Committee. Finally, after the Bill was introduced in the House--and that was in itself a
			strenuous, collassal task--it was referred to the Ways and
				Means Committee. All that work gone for nought--and yet we refuse to be
			discouraged.</p>
		<p> Once I asked the advice of a Congresswoman. She was
			popular, well-liked, intelligent apparently. Yet she exclaimed to me bitterly: &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, dont send any of that Birth
				Control literature to my office! My stenographer is
				bitterly opposed to Birth Control, and any day, any of this Birth Control matters
				comed in the day&#8217;s mail to my desk, she goes up in the air--and makes it too hot for
				me the rest of the day.&#8221; I found out that secretaries and stenographers wield a
			vast unseen power behind the scenes in Washington--and the Congressman, already
			dominated by fear and afraid to ruin his own political futures--dare not act contrary to
			the advice of the secretary.</p>
		<p> Another Woman Congressman said to me: &#8220;For
				Heaven&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t ask women to touch this bill! It&#8217;s too controversial!&#8221;</p>
		<p> Opponents of Birth Control <span class="del">have</span>
			
       &#8593;use&#8595;
     only the negative TACTICS OF PROTEST, but because they are so
			diabolically vigilant, even blocking our moves before we have had time to complete our
			plans. Yet in spite of these odds, we have accomplished much. Our bill is introduced.
			But we need your support. We need ammunition. We need reserve troops.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="del">
	[<em>two words illegible</em>]
	</span> ACTIVE, DYNAMIC public opinion,
			concentrated, focussed, mobilized, that has brought 
       &#8593;produced&#8595;
     this desired
			result. <span class="del">
	[<em>one word illegible</em>]
	</span> Few American citizens
				<span class="del">have</span> realized that the Federal Laws concerning the transportion of
			preventives do not merely concern the use of the United States mails and common
			carriers. Do you realize that Section 312 of the federal Penal Code makes it a CRIME
			PUNISHABLE BY TWO YEARS IMPRISONMENT and a FINE of $2,000 even to have in your
			possession any article or information designed to prevent conception?</p>
		<p> It was this that aroused the people of Winston-Salem
				North Carolina. We sent workers there, and aroused the determined support of
			the enlightened voters of Representative Frank
				Hancock&#8217;s constituency. They made him &#8220;Birth-Control-conscious&#8221; in a week&#8217;s
			time. Their dynamic, determined, persistent activity, courageously, challenging
					<span class="del">
	[<em>one word illegible</em>]
	</span>, expressed in letters,
			phone calls, visitors, could not turned away with any conventional polite dismission. of
			Representative Hancock, they demanded pointblank: Would he introduce this bill? And
			knowing their earnestness he replyed that he would. And he has.</p>
		<p> We have since been working to get the Bill in the Senate. The hearing before the ways and Means Committee
			is set for . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
		<p> Most of the economic and social muddles which the Congress is trying to clear up have been the results of mistakes of the past.
			Clean them up, we all cry; but in doing so, do not neglect the great, basic, problems of
			humanity-- the problems of MOTHERHOOD And of Childhood. Therefore we are convinced that
			it is our right and our duty to compel Congress to erase from the Criminal Code of this Country those
				Sections 211, 245 and 312, which are an insult to American Womanhood and a disgrace to the Country
			which permits them to remain there to block our path to freedom and realization.</p>
		<p> I accept this medal as your pledge that you are with me in this battle to the
				<span class="del">bitter</span>
			
       &#8593;victorious&#8595;
     end; <span class="del">and that as</span> Your gesture has been a public one and
			a courageous one. It is likewise a challenge to the opponents of Birth Control. Let your
			interest continue in the Active Tense, not the Passive. Join me in the 
       &#8593;is&#8595;
    
			glorious battle for American womanhood and childhood, in the creation of a newer, better
			civilization for to-morrow. You will thank me then, as I thank you know-- for Life
			active, dynamic, <span class="del">fighting</span>
			
       &#8593;crusading for a cause&#8595;
    , I assure you, is more joyful and 
       &#8593;thrilling&#8595;
    
			than life passive, inhibited, fearful. I have been in for twenty-years, and this medal
			gives me the inspiration to go on for twenty-years more, but I hope that Women will be
			freed long before that. Help us to make that hope become a fact. I thank you. </p>
