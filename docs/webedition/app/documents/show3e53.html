        <h1>ANOTHER WOMAN</h1>
        <p>She is a sociologist. She is efficient. She
            is business woman. She is of invincible virtue. She is indefatigable and relentless in
            her "correction" of human nature. She is a brilliant example of that rapidly growing
            group of respectable folk who have discovered profitable and highly honorable careers in
            the exploitation of the victims of our social "law and order". This exploitation
            operates under the name of "charities and correction". You must be fully conscious of
            your own moral superiority before you can successfully become addicted to the pleasures
            of "correcting" the faults and the crimes of the poor, the miserable, the ill-fed and
            the shoddily clothed, who fail to observe the virtues you impersonate.</p>
        <p>Your own invincible, well buttressed virtue, your own moral superiority will facilitate
            this noble work of "correction". Even though you may be a woman,
            the consciousness of this noble moral integrity and superiority will enable you to find
            pleasurable expression in the chastisement of those fellow beings who do not conform to
            your own moral standards. </p>
        <p>This suggestion should be sufficient to explain the brilliant success of our energetic
            and efficient lady, expert, this "sociologist", as the head of that
            large correctional institution for girls who committed the crime of conducting
            themselves according to the instincts of most human beings.</p>
        <p>It would be unwarranted to assume that experts in "correction" bear
            any ill-will toward those who are their victims. On the contrary, it is safe to infer
            that they look down upon them with pity if not sympathy, as long as the victims submit
            tamely to the punishment inflicted upon them, and continue to contribute to the
            prosperity of the institutions which furnish employment and pleasure to our
                "practical sociologists".</p>
        <p>Only when the victims rebel, revolt, inaugurate a hunger-strike, or in any way indicate
            that they are of human flesh and blood, with other purposes in life than to live
            according to another's ideals, no matter how lofty and noble those ideals may be, is the
            expert in correction ready to revert to methods of torture, to tortures refined and
            adapted to our modern psychology, but no less effective and intense than in earlier
            periods.</p>
        <p>These tortures are often indulged in vicariously, being performed out of sight and by
            some subordinate, but perhaps quite as enjoyable to a refined and virtuous temperament,
            calling into activity the imagination and eliminating the sight of the victim's
            resistance.</p>
        <p>Successfully to supervise a jail, some such characteristics as these we suggest are
            requisite. Otherwise prison discipline might collapse, our practical sociologists would
            be jobless, and even the reasons for sending people to jail might vanish. But if we are
            to have larger and more efficient jails and asylums, which the experts of correction
            look upon as the true index of advancing civilization, since such offices will render
            them of more importance in the community, it is obvious that we must create new crimes
            and capture fresh victims. Only thus can our experts express their temperament.</p>
        <p>It is not really absurd to foresee the time in our glorious American life when most of
            the population will live in jails, either as commissioners or sub-commissioners of
            correction or as criminals. This is undoubtedly the aim of our eminent
                "&gt;correctionists", as well as of that of the constantly
            increasing group of Americans who advocate jail for every one who thinks or speaks not
            as they do.</p>
        <p>Miss Edelsohn has been directly protesting
            against this exploitation and the type of mind that has brought it into existence and
            profits by it, protesting by a hunger-strike at Blackwell's Island, and unless this
            protest is made general and effective by everyone who wants the right to think for
            himself and herself, and to express thoughts freely, such people need not be surprised
            to find themselves in some jail or another. For our "practical
                sociologists" and "reformers" are gaining power, and
            are taking as much delight in keeping people in jail as the magistrates are in sending
            them there.</p>
        <p>Women have been too ready to admire other women who, with inflated ideas of
            self-importance, are willing to degrade themselves and their sex by assuming the
            barbaric posts that decent men are giving up--in short by becoming detectives,
            policewomen and commissioners of correction. Let us proclaim such women as traitors and
            enemies of the working class!</p>
