		<h1>Woman's Error and Her Debt</h1>
		<h3 class="italics">By Margaret Sanger</h3>
		<p>THE MOST far-reaching social development of modern times is the revolt of woman against
			sex servitude. The most important force in the remaking of the world is a free
			motherhood. Beside this force, the elaborate international programmes of modern
			statesmen are weak and superficial. Diplomats may formulate leagues of nations and
			nations may pledge their utmost strength to maintain them, statesmen may dream of
			reconstructing the world out of alliances, hegemonies and spheres of influence, but
			woman, continuing to produce explosive populations, will convert these pledges into the
			proverbial scraps of paper; or she may, by controlling birth, lift motherhood to the
			plane of a voluntary, intelligent function, and remake the world. When the world is thus
			remade, it will exceed the dream of statesman, reformer and revolutionist. </p>
		<p>Only in recent years has woman's position as the gentler and weaker half of the human
			family been emphatically and generally questioned. Men assumed that this was woman's
			place; woman herself accepted it. It seldom occurred to anyone to ask whether she would
			go on occupying it forever.</p>
		<p>Upon the mere surface of woman's organized protests there were no indications that she
			was desirous of achieving a fundamental change in her position. She claimed the right of
			suffrage and legislative regulation of her working hours, and asked that her property
			rights be equal to those of the man. None of these demands, however, affected directly
			the most vital factors of her existence. Whether she won her point or failed to win it,
			she remained a dominated weakling in a society controlled by men.</p>
		<p>WOMAN'S ACCEPTANCE of her inferior status was the more real because it was unconscious.
			She had chained herself to her place in society and the family through the maternal
			functions of her nature, and only chains thus strong could have bound her to her lot as
			a brood animal for the masculine civilizations of the world. In accepting her role as
			the "weaker and gentler half," she accepted that function. In turn, the
			acceptance of that function fixed the more firmly her rank as an inferior.</p>
		<p>Caught in this "vicious circle," woman has, through her reproductive ability, founded and
			perpetuated the tyrannies of the Earth. Whether it was the tyranny of a monarchy, an
			oligarchy or a republic, the one indispensable factor of its existence was, as it is
			now, hordes of human beings--human beings so plentiful as to be cheap, and so cheap that
			ignorance was their natural lot. Upon the rock of an unenlightened, submissive maternity
			have these been founded; upon the product of such a maternity have they flourished.</p>
		<p>No despot ever flung forth his legions to die in foreign conquest, no privilege-ruled
			nation ever erupted across its borders, to lock in death embrace with another, but
			behind them loomed the driving power of a population too large for its boundaries and
			its natural resources.</p>
		<p>No period of low wages or of idleness with their want among the workers, no peonage or
			sweatshop, no child-labor factory, ever came into being, save from the same source. Nor
			have famine and plague been as much "acts of God" as acts of too prolific
			mothers. They, also, as all students know, have their basic causes in over-population. </p>
		<p>THE CREATORS of over-population are the women, who, while wringing their hands over each
			fresh horror, submit anew to their task of producing the multitudes who will bring about
			the <span class="italics">next</span> tragedy of civilization.</p>
		<p>While unknowingly laying the foundations of tyrannies and providing the human tinder for
			racial conflagrations, woman was also unknowingly creating slums, filling asylums with
			insane, and institutions with other defectives. She was replenishing the ranks of the
			prostitutes, furnishing grist for the criminal courts and inmates for prisons. Had she
			planned deliberately to achieve this tragic total of human waste and misery, she could
			hardly have done it more effectively.</p>
		<p>Woman's passivity under the burden of her disastrous task was almost altogether that of
			ignorant resignation. She knew virtually nothing about her reproductive nature and less
			about the consequences of her excessive child-bearing. It is true that, obeying the
			inner urge of their nature, <span class="italics">some</span> women revolted. They went
			even to the extreme of infanticide and abortion. Usually their revolts were not general
			enough. They fought as individuals, not as a mass. In the mass they sank back into blind
			and hopeless subjection. They went on breeding with staggering rapidity those
			numberless, undesired children who become the clogs and the destroyers of
			civilization.</p>
		<p>Today, however, woman is rising in fundamental revolt. Even her efforts at mere reform
			are, as we shall see later, steps in that direction. Underneath each of them is the
			feminine urge to complete freedom. Millions of women are asserting their right to
			voluntary motherhood. They are determined to decide for themselves whether they shall
			become mothers, under what conditions and when. This is the fundamental revolt referred
			to. It is for woman the key to the temple of liberty.</p>
		<p>EVEN AS BIRTH CONTROL is the means by which woman attains basic freedom, so it is the
			means by which she must and will uproot the evil she has wrought through her submission.
			As she has unconsciously and ignorantly brought about social disaster, so must and will
			she consciously and intelligently <span class="italics">undo</span> that disaster and
			create a new and a better order. </p>
		<p>The task is hers. It cannot be avoided by excuses, nor can it be delegated. It is not
			enough for woman to point to the self-evident domination of man. Nor does it avail to
			plead the guilt of rulers and the exploiters of labor. It makes no difference that she
			does not formulate industrial systems nor that she is an instinctive believer in social
			justice. In her submission lies her error and her guilt. By her failure to withhold the
			multitudes of children who have made inevitable the most flagrant of our social evils,
			she incurred a debt to society. Regardless of her own wrongs, regardless of her lack of
			opportunity and regardless of all other considerations, she must pay that debt. </p>
		<p>She must not think to pay this debt in any superficial way. She cannot pay it with
			palliatives--with child-labor laws, prohibition, regulation of prostitution and
			agitation against war. Political nostrums and social panaceas are but incidentally and
			superficially useful. They do not touch the source of the social disease. </p>
		<p>War, famine, poverty and oppression of the workers will continue while woman makes life
			cheap. They will cease only when she limits her reproductivity and human life is no
			longer a thing to be wasted.</p>
		<p>Two chief obstacles hinder the discharge of this tremendous obligation. The first and the
			lesser is the legal barrier. Dark age laws would still deny to her the knowledge of her
			reproductive nature. Such knowledge is indispensable to intelligent motherhood and she
			must achieve it, despite absurd statutes and equally absurd moral canons.</p>
		<p>The second and more serious barrier is her own ignorance of the extent and effect of her
			submission. Until she knows the evil her subjection has wrought to herself, to her
			progeny and to the world at large, she cannot wipe out that evil.</p>
		<p>To get rid of these obstacles is to invite attack from the forces of reaction which are
			so strongly entrenched in our present-day society. It means warfare in every phase of
			her life. Nevertheless, at whatever cost, she must emerge from her ignorance and assume
			her responsibility.</p>
		<p>She can do this only when she has awakened to a knowledge of herself and of the
			consequences of her ignorance. The first step is Birth Control. Through Birth Control
			she will attain to voluntary motherhood. Having attained this, the basic freedom of her
			sex, she will cease to enslave herself and the mass of humanity. Then, through the
			understanding of the intuitive forward urge within her, she will not stop at patching up
			the world; she will remake it.</p>
