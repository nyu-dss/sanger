<h1 class="italics">Impressions of the Amsterdam Conference</h1>
<h3 class="italics">By Margaret Sanger</h3>
<p>The first great truth that I bring home from the international congress on contraceptives, held
in Amsterdam August 29-30, is this: that our
movement in the theoretical aspects is far in advance of the practical phase. There was unanimous
agreement upon principles,--upon the economic, the social and the hygienic, the political and
international necessity for Birth Control. But the practical methods and devices offered by the
various delegates from practically every country in Europe were new and untried by
other delegates, and questioned by them. Each country offered its individual method which was
unknown to the rest of the delegates.</p>
<p>One of the most instructive and enlightening phases of the conference was the opportunity it
offered to delegates to visit the clinics, where demonstrations of the various methods were given
under the auspices of the Dutch League and proved of
practical values. They vindicate our claim for clinics in all countries.</p>
<p>The conference took place in the Hotel Hollandia, in Amsterdam, on Aug. 29th and 30th, and was
attended by Dr. and Mrs. Drysdale and Dr. Haire
(England), Mme. de Beer-Meijers, Mynheer and
Mme. Kiersch de Jung, Mr. de Vries, Mr. S. Ten Cate and Dr. Risselada (Holland), and Dr. E. Goldstein (Germany). Mr. G. Hardy (France, treasurer of the Bureau, and Dr.
Rutgers (late hon. sec.), wrote expressing regret at being
unable to come, and others were prevented from doing so by various engagements.</p>
<p>A very useful and full discussion on all the best known preventive devices took place, and
decisions were arrived at concerning the most effective devices and the technique connected with
them. Demonstrations were kindly given by Mme. Kiersch de Jung and Mme. van Huevel, two of the ladies trained by Dr. Rutgers and on the
Dutch League's list of helpers, to the medical and lady members of the conference on the fitting of
certain preventive devices. A cordial vote of thanks was accorded to Mme. de Beer-Meijers at the
conclusion of the conference, for her greatly appreciated arrangements, and it was decided that a
full International Neo-Malthusian Congress should be held in the last week of August in next
year.</p>
<p>The following resolution was unanimously passed at the conference, at the instance of M.G.
Hardy:</p>
This conference of the International Neo-Malthusian Bureau
of Correspondence and Defence wishes to register a strong protest against the laws and
measures repressing neo-Malthusian or Birth Control propaganda which have existed or recently been
enacted in various countries, and against the prosecutions which have been instituted against such
propagandists. It wishes to point out that such propaganda, provided that it is carried out with due
regard to public decency and on eugenic lines, is of the utmost value to every nation as a means of
reducing poverty and social unrest, and of improving the quality and viability of the race.
<p>It was felt that the conclusions arrived at would be of great service in the preparation of
practical handbooks or leaflets, but that several points needed further study and settlement, and
various members undertook to obtain information on these points with the view of bringing them
before a committee on contraceptive devices, which it was decided should meet at the time of the
International Congress.</p>
