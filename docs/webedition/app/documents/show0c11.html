<h1>The New Women of Japan</h1>
<h3>By Margaret Sanger.</h3>

<h2>I.</h2>
<p>Our average Occidental conception of that mysteriously elusive creature, the Japanese woman, has
been created out of a number of romantic fallacies. It is built up in part, I think, out of those
three little maids from school who giggle and simper through Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado". It is drawn to no small extent from the gaudy theatricalism of "Madame Butterfly". The color-prints that aroused so much enthusiasm toward the end of the
last century, but which date from a much earlier period, strengthened our romantic illusion and the
unrestrained exoticism of writers like the late Lafeadie
Hearn further exalted this perfect flower of Japanese civilization and completed the
apotheosis of a creature it has now become almost sacrilege to lock upon as a human-all-too-human
being.</p>
<p>This view of the Japanese woman is based not upon the observation and study of the Japanese
today, working and toiling in fields, factories and workshops, but upon the decorative ladies of the
old feudal regime, phantoms today of the irrevocable past. There may be a considerable element of
truth in those romantic pictures of the ladies of old Japan. Despite their unrestrained romanticism,
they are not absolutely false to the women of Japan today. But it is infinitely more
worth while for us, in the interests of international understanding and amity, to give up once and
for all, all highly colored generalizations concerning such distant folk as the Japanese. Too long
have we been told and shown how posteresque and how picturesque are the women of Japan, how
different they are from our own flappers and feminists, or the plodding workaday women of our drab
Western civilization. It is my conviction, strengthened by a limited but intensified visit to the
"land of the cherry blossom", that it is our first duty to find out, not how mysteriously Oriental
the Japanese are, but how alike fundamentally they are to the rest of us. Skim over the surface of
the Japanese scene in the manner of the average American tourist, and only the decorative
differences appear. Delve beneath the surface and gradually, inevitably you cannot escape the
conclusion that contemporary Japan is confronted by the same complex problems generated by modern
industrialism. Accentuated, intensified by the swiftness and the impact of the industrial revolution
in the little island empire, they are nevertheless the same problems.</p>
<p>To acquire an adequate conception of the living Japanese women of the present generation and the
next, one must understand something not only of her past, but also of the changes wrought in her
character and outlook by the new industrialism. Practically half of the total female population of
Japan--a number conservatively estimated at thirteen millions, are engaged in gainful occupations,
in fields, mills, factories, workshops, or engaged in home industries. And yet, few are economically
independent. To understand why, let us survey rapidly the early history of Japanese women.</p>


<h2>II.</h2>
<p>It is true that the Japanese woman is the product of centuries of self-sacrifice, almost
countless ages of self-abnegation. But historians have discovered unmistakable traces of an early
matriarchate. Worshipped as the greatest of the sun-goddesses, Tenshe-daijin, who is still honored as the first ancestress of the Imperial family, is
depicted as a most powerful and efficient deity, dominating the military, political and agricultural
destinies of an invincible race. Japanese historians surmise that far in the prehistoric ages, when
the islands were first invaded by that indomitable race, the prevailing economic system was a
primitive communism dominated by the material gens. During the reign of Jimmu
(about 600 B.C.) many women warriors flourished among the native tribes of Kyushu. There were not merely women generals, but whole battalions of
such Amazons. In this respect Japanese mythology parallels closely the Norse, with its Valkyries and
its other radiant goddesses.</p>
<p class="underline">When Japanese society entered the period of recorded history, the family had
evolved out of the definitely matriarchal stage. The descent of woman from the high position of
goddess began. With the private ownership of property and land her position began steadily to
decline. Nevertheless, there are innumberable recorded instances of women active and even dominating
in political and social fields. There is the notable instance of the Empress Jingu,
who in the third century conquered Korea and for half a century ruled over Japan with a vigor that
suggests Catherine of Russia.</p>
<p>There seems to be evidence, if we accept the authority of Madame Kikuye Yamakawa, that in those heroic and epic days, Japanese women enjoyed freedom and
equality with men, and were their inferiors neither in mental or physical capacity.</p>
<p>With the advent in the eighth century of the first code of laws-- the Taiho-rei-- not only was private property firmly established, but monogamous marriage was
definitely codified. A man might have but one legal wife, though the code permitted him to support
as many mistresses as he desired. Though the Taiho-rei still recognized their right of inheritance,
women were banished from public life. In the next four centuries the conduct of women was gradually
but progressively circumscribed. In the Fujiwara era, the woman of the upper classes could not speak
directly to any male acquaintance. Friendly intercourse with any member of the opposite sex--with
the exception of her husband--was deemed not only immodest but immoral. Such women, however,
remained under the protection of their blood relatives. They were not financially dependent upon
their husbands. Divorce was possible. A second marriage was possible. Since these women remained
members of their own families, they were not absolutely the property, body and soul, of their
husbands. The great race of heroic superwomen had not yet died out. It is true that they were
prescribed from military or political activities. Their pent-up energies found expression in
literature. The Fujiwara era is noted fro its renowned literary women. I find a curious parallel
here with the nineteenth century of our own Anglo-Saxon world, surely the most circumscribed for
women, and yet notable for its George Eliots, its Bronte sisters, its many
poetesses and women novelists.</p>
<p>But it was with the rise of the powerful military lords, all bent on conquest and reducing the
majority of the race to slavery and servitude, that the women of Japan were completely subjugated,
spiritually as well as physically. At the beginning of the Kamakura era in the thirteenth century
the great structure of Japanese feudalism was raised--a structure not merely of outward government
and tyranny, but one that rigorously determined every act, every thought, every impulse of the
Japanese people. In its outward or external aspect, this feudalism did not fall until the middle of
the last century. But the rigorous mental and spiritual discipline it enforced upon generation after
generation of men and women still lives--a powerful unseen force, silent, intangible, resisting with
the inertia of centuries every effort to implant in the Japanese mind the seeds of Western
democratic ideals.</p>
<p>More obviously than the men, the women of Japan today incarnate this ancient tradition, this
unchanging code of conduct. Not in a mere half century can the women of Japan free themselves of the
severely imposed discipline of five. For according to the code imposed by the feudal empire, woman
has deprived of every personal and economic liberty. Even the right of inheritance was taken from
her. Property descended to the eldest son, his younger brothers and sisters becoming his subjects.
There was no freedom of choice in love. Obedience became the crowning virtue for women, and with
obedience, chastity. The blackest crime was adultery and it was punishable by death. She was denied
the right of divorce. Her husband was chosen for her by her father, or by her eldest brother if the
father were dead. Upon her departure for the house of her husband, the parting warning of her parent
was that she should never return to them alive. A widow of the Samurai caste was forbidden to
remarry.</p>
<p>The Onna Daigaku (the Moral Code for Women) formulated the
morality for women of the feudal ages. To a great or less degree, it remains valid today. Woman is a
slave from birth to death; first to her father; then to her husband; finally to her eldest son, who
becomes head of the family. For almost any reason, the husband might cast her out--if she were not
obedient to her husband or to her parents-in-law, if she were childless, if she were talkative, if
she gossiped about her relatives, if she suffered from a malignant disease. She must look upon her
husband "as upon Heaven"--with awe, fear and reverence. Even though her lord and master be
unfaithful, the Onna Daigaku warns her to bear him no grudge--she might remonstrate only in a quiet,
persuasive and modest fashion. The Onna Daigaku summarizes the all too prevailing masculine opinion
that women are inherently stupid, spiteful, disobedient, slanderous and jealous. It therefore
counsels: "Women shall get up early in the morning and go to bed late in the evening.
She must never take a nap in the daytime, and she must always be careful in her household duties.
She shall be industrious at sewing, weaving, spinning, and embroidering. She shall not take much tea
or wine. She shall not visit places of amusement, such as theatres of musicals." In everything,
woman is advised to admit he superiority of man. She must only follow and obey him. "A woman must never get angry, even when she is despised and insulted....she must bear everything,
and always be careful and timid." </p>
<p>Lest we congratulate ourselves too rapidly upon our own superiority, let us recall that there is
nothing essentially Oriental in this attitude. Is it not identical with that voiced by
Petruchio, who spoke for the men of his own generation and a good many of ours when
he exclaimed;</p>
<p class="blockquote">"I will be master of what is mine own.-- She is my goods, my
chattels; she is my house. My household stuff, my field, my barn, My horse, my ox, my ass, my
anything..."</p>
<p>And when Katharine, tamed at last, voices--perhaps with her tongue in her
cheek--her allegiance to her lord, her king, her governor, she expresses the attitude of the typical
Japanese woman of past centuries, and even of the present: </p>
<p class="blockquote">"Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper. Thy head, thy
sovereign... Such duty as the subject owes the prince, E'en such a woman to her husband owes, And
when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour What is she but a foul and contending rebel And graceless
traitor to her loving lord?"</p>


<h2>III.</h2>
<p>Such was woman's place in the rigid, inelastic structure erected by Japanese feudalism, a society
which might be described as a hierarchy of loyalties and self-sacrifices. Woman in this hierarchy is
lowest in the social scale, deprived of the rights of personality or individuality. The legitimate
wives were reduced to the position of menials. Their chief function was the bearing of children, who
were not valued so much as individuals but as future units to uphold the Empire. Fully to comprehend
Japanese society we must realize and remember always that under the ancien regime, the individual
was subordinated always to the larger social organism. Legally and morally he existed only as a
function of the State. As similarly, a woman existed only as a function of her husband; she was his
housekeeper and the bearer of his children. When she was married, she had to shave off her eyebrows
and dye her teeth black. Her hair was then done in the Maru-mage
coiffure, a style of hair-dressing for the married only. The persistence of the Onna Daigaku code, and of the ancient feudal ideas of womanhood is painfully evident in the
prevalence of these fashions. To this day most married women do their hair in the Maru-mage fashion.
I saw many women with dyed teeth. And a large proportion of women cut their hair upon the death of
their husbands. Until a few years ago, short hair among our own women bespoke defiance of
convention; with the Japanese, tradition rather than fashion dictates the arrangement of a woman's
hair. But these are minor customs which accentuate our essential samenesses rather than our
differences.</p>
<p class="underline">The greatest mystery today concerning the women of Japan is the perpetuation of
the feudal psychology. The feudal system fell just before the outbreak of our Civil War. The
industrial revolution accomplished in our Western countries gradually and over a long period of
years, invaded the island Empire of the Mikado with an impact and a shock the repercussions of which
are still evident. Industrialism, dynamic, a force of relentless iron energy invaded a society not
only ill-prepared to receive it, but aggressively hostile to the materialism of machinery.
Completely isolated for centuries, the Japanese had believed that they had nothing in common with
the other nations, that their race was made up of finer and nobler stuff, that their history, their
ideals, their customs and usages were all exclusively their own. The family system especially was
held as a unique treasure of the race, unparalleled in any other society. But with the rapid
industrialization of Japan--a process by the way that has not yet been completed--most of the feudal
ideas have degenerated or dissipated. Seemingly the most rigid, the most persistent, the most
immovable, is the tradition concerning woman.</p>


<h2>IV.</h2>
<p>We need not seek far for a convincing explanation. Like the ancient tradition of Japan, modern
industry is also feudal. Machinery is a rigorous disciplinarian. Industrialism has not brought
freedom to the women of Japan. The low status of women was admirably, if sinisterly, suited to the
purposes of modern industrialism and of the factory system with its ever increasing demand for cheap
labor and unskilled operatives. And so today, instead of the decorative ladies and the geisha girls
of the old regime, we find in Japan millions of women and girls working long hours in factories, in
cotton and silk mills, a million women in commerce and communications, women miners, (at least one
hundred thousand of these), women fishers, with a lesser but ever increasing number as teachers,
doctors, nurses, dentists, midwives and chemists. They are leaving the countryside by the thousands
to enter factories. Dr. Ishiwara of the Home Department has
estimated that fully two hundred thousand country girls leave home for the cities and industrial
centres every year.</p>
<p>Most of these girls are recruited by means of the term-contract system. They are bought as
apprentices for a certain specified term generally from three to five years, though this
apprenticeship may extend over a period as long as ten years. These girls are called "kako"--"the bought ones". It is not the girls themselves, but their parents,
who receive their wages, small as they are, during this apprenticeship. The girls themselves receive
but scanty allowances for their personal needs. The employers furnish the girls with food, lodgings,
clothing and other necessities of life, but as a rule they are of poor quality. To no small extent
personal liberty is curtailed; and the prohibitions of the old feudal system are not noticeably
lightened. In some weaving districts, I was told, the mothers sometimes scold their children by
shouting, "I'll sell you to the weavers!"</p>
<p>These girls and young women are of course recruited from the poorest peasantry. Resident
recruiting agents, usually ex-policemen or petty officials, are said to keep a close watch over
promising material for the factories. Besides these factory agents residing in the country
districts, there are traveling agents who are generally called "hito-kai" or "man buyers". As in our Western countries, there has been a growing protest
against the worst evils of this industrial slavery. But due in great part to the low value placed
upon women except in their capacity as child bearers, it has taken practically nineteen years of
protest and agitation to enact an effective law for the protection of female labor. But this factory
law concerned itself only with establishments employing more than fifteen persons or occupied with
dangerous trades. It did not touch the smaller workshops where conditions are the worst, and it did
not concern itself with the protection of men above the age of fifteen. The main points of this law
which became effective in September 1916 are as follows:</p>
"Children below twelve years of age may not be employed. They
work in the smaller work shops and the home industries, outside the protection of the law."The working day for women and children under fifteen shall not exceed twelve
hours. A clause permitting two hours overwork is effective until 1930)."Children under fifteen and women cannot be employed between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. But
exceptions are made in factories when continuous operation is necessary, and where the workers are
divided into more than two daily shifts."
<p>Incomplete as the present factory laws of Japan are, their enforcement is even more fragmentary.
Competent authorities in Tokyo told me of open violations of the
law. Only two hundred inspectors, said Madame Yamakawa, had
been appointed to supervise more than twenty-three thousand factories. The World War, which gave a
strong impetus to Japanese industry, also had the effect, due to the abnormal situation, of throwing
factory laws into abeyance. In the silk filatures, no less than three hundred thousand young girls
are employed. I visited one of these plants near Nagoya where I
found at least seven hundred young girls. I was informed that during the rush season their work
began at five in the morning and ended not before half-past seven in the evening. An American
missionary has written a vivid picture of these filatures:</p>
<p class="blockquote">"'O God, that bread should be so dear And flesh and blood so
cheap!"</p>
<p>"I read that when I first began to be interested in Japan, and to know that it was her woman who
were bearing the heaviest burdens, and it has been thrumming through my head ever since. It sang
itself over and over again in my brain two days ago when I went through a silk spinning mill, and
saw some little girls, about ten years of age, swiftly twirling off the slender threads from the
cocoons and catching them on the spindles. From six in the morning until five at night; with all
windows closed to keep the room moist and hot, they work; and then dinner, a bath, and bed, to get
up for the next day's work. Two Sundays a month vacation, and about seven dollars a month pay, of
which one and a half goes for board. Practically prisoners in the dormitory--little girls whose
olive cheeks should be rosy, and whose black eyes should be snapping from racing and dancing about!"
A few minutes in these rooms, which I myself visited not only in Japan but also in
Korea and China, and one feels sick. The air must be kept hot and
moist; and these children and young women must slave out their young lives in that enervating
steam.</p>
<p>In the cotton mills conditions are even worse. I was invited to visit the Kanegafuchi plant, the
largest cotton mill in the Empire and spent half a day there as the guest of the directors. There I
found beautiful gardens, playgrounds, an emergency hospital, rest rooms, baths and the most advanced
sanitation. There was even a kindergarten where the women employees might "park" their infants
during the working hours. This type of paternalistic welfare work, splendid as it appears to the
casual visitor, who might be disarmed by the extreme courtesy of his hosts, is at best palliative, a
compensatory effort to divert attention from those young women and girls who, with weary manner and
sleepy eyes, toil at the spindles, many of them on the night shift. In the average Japanese cotton
mill the working shift is twelve hours, day and night. Dust and fine particles of fabric fall like
minute snowflakes upon the toilers, amid the deafening roar of the relentless power engines. The
growth of these young girls in the cotton mills is stunted; their resistance to infectious and
malignant diseases is broken down. From standing so many long hours, they develop flat feet, with
more serious maladies. Tubercular arthritis has made deep inroads upon this section of Japanese
womanhood. I am not making these statements from my own necessarily limited observations. They are
based upon the investigations of Dr. Ishiwara of the Home Department and of Mr. Koiyama, an expert in the department of Agriculture and Commerce.</p>


<h2>V.</h2>
<p>There is of course a grave danger in any attempt to arrive at a complete and final generalization
concerning the women of any race. There are women and women. We would scoff if any Japanese visitor
to our own country should generalize concerning "the American woman" as a distinct and separate
entity. We American women are of all sorts and conditions. We are highly differentiated as
individuals. Our civilization is unceasingly producing new "types"--new "sports" in the biological
sense. It has taken us but a decade or two to swing from the majestic Gibson girl to the perplexing
"flapper". About the only thing we are absolutely sure of as far as American women are concerned, is
that we may be sure of nothing. The American woman is heterogeneous, changing, plastic. She has
evolved beyond the stage of homogeneity. She is no longer a general, easily defined type. She has
become an individual.</p>
<p>Such is not the case with Japanese women. In Japan it is impossible to discover any such wide
variation in type and spirit that is so inescapable to the observer of the women of American and
Europe. The range of variation narrows down to the point of complete non-existence.
From the lowest serving maid to the finest and most beautiful production of countless generations of
aristocracy, certain indelible traits immediately impress themselves upon you. First of all there is
the low voice, fluttering and birdlike; there is the universal demeanor of modesty-- modesty carried
to the point of shyness; there is the silence and the subservience to the male, particularly to the
husband; there is that almost impersonal and ritualistic politeness in behavior, most noticeable in
those relations where we would naturally expect Japanese women to throw aside their habitual and
conventional reserve. This trait was most eloquently revealed to me during a visit in one of the
aristocratic homes of Tokyo. There I had the opportunity of observing the beautiful relationship
exhibited between a Japanese mother and her two grown daughters. In striking contrast to the spirit
of comradeship between parents and children that has now become ordinary in our own country was the
ceremonious, almost ritualistic respect shown by these two daughters, representative of the young
generation, toward their mother. There was neither intimacy nor familiarity. There was a
consideration almost distant in the respect shown to the mother, as a representative undoubtedly of
that most permanent of all Japanese institutions, the family. Yet it would be a mistake to assume,
because of this delicate formality that existed here in the very bosom of the family, that love and
fondness were absent. It is rather that old Japan had succeeded in extending its esthetic sense into
the realm of everyday life. In conventionalizing these relationship Japanese society has undoubtedly
produced a thing of beauty. Yet here, as in other fields, I cannot escape the conclusion that the
individual, especially the individual woman, has been taught to sacrifice her own self-development
and self-expression to an external superimposed ideal.</p>
<p>Exquisite and decorative as the upper-class Japanese woman is in her home, her example has not
been a happy one upon her less fortunate countrywomen, for whom she serves as an example for all the
feminine virtues. She is protected and cherished; she is a living work of art articularly created by
the imagination of numberless generations of men. Her interests may be confined to her house, her
garden, her children. Modesty, shyness, silence and beautiful clothes may become her. But for the
millions of working women of Japan, thrust by the new industrialism into factory and workshop, doing
double duty not merely as wage earners but as the bearers of the next generation, silence and
intellectual dependence is no longer desirable. "A Japanese woman must be silent in
public if she wishes to be respected." This ancient rule is almost universally and implicitly
obeyed today, even by the most educated and emancipated woman of Japan. But that radical changes are
imminent is evident by the abolition--at the very time of my visit in Japan--of Article Five of the
police law of the empire, which prohibited women from attending any political meeting, promoting any
such meeting, or joining any political association. That they have finally, after a long struggle,
won this right must not be interpreted as a sign that the women of Japan are aggressively determined
to enter the field of politics.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it is a sign, I think, of the decay of the traditional and feudal ideas
concerning woman among the younger generation of Japanese men. The men of Japan, rather than the
women, have assimilated our Occidental ideals of individualism and personal ambition. The men are
forging ahead rapidly, due to their swift emancipation from the feudal ideals of loyalty and
submission to the liege-lord.</p>
<p>I have spoken of the inertia and the deadweight of ancient Japanese tradition which acts as a
silent, mysterious power upon the Japanese people. It is the Japanese woman, the "flower of countless generations, reaching back through the ages of tradition, centuries of
self-abnegation", as Mr. Julian Street has expressed it,
who not only bears the burden of this unseen power, but is indeed the perpetuator of it. Essentially
conservative, essentially the product of this strange and so little understood past, the Japanese
woman in my opinion does not possess in her typical psychology, the strong desire of rebellion or of
change. The initiator of the change, in my opinion, will not be the Japanese woman, but the changing
environment itself, which will continue to change the masculine outlook.</p>
<p>To realize the power of ancient feudalism over Japanese women, one must study them only at home,
but in the Japanese colonies of Hawaii, Korea and </p>
<p>Once outside the sphere of that ancient discipline, once brought into friendly intercourse with
the men and women of other countries and other races, the Japanese woman may be observed actually to
"blossom out" as an intelligent, gentle, outspoken human being. In Korea and China, especially, I
was surprised to discover her distinct intellectual gifts and the shrewd penetration of her
observations concerning the fundamental truths of human nature and of life in general. This fact,
for me at least, presages a glorious future for the self-development of the women of Japan.</p>
<p>Unlike the men, the majority of whom have with amazing rapidity taken to "foreign" clothes and
foreign habits within Japan, the women on the whole still wear the traditional kimono, which though
it may possess the distinct advantage of freeing her from the cruel dictates of passing fashion,
presents the most complex difficulties from the point of view of washing and laundering. I do not
believe that the women of Japan will discard their beautiful costumes or sacrifice their aesthetic
and decorative sense upon the altar of Occidental progress and Western materialism. Her
emancipation, which will come very slowly and very gradually, will not be effected by the adoption
of "knickers" or any other form of bifurcated garment, nor by the "bobbed hair route". Essentially a
conservative creature, she will never go to the superficial extremes of our own feminists, who in
their hurry to have paid too much attention to surface values and altogether too little to a study
of woman's basic nature and most deep-seated needs. Not by the mere imitation of the masculine
element of the community, not by the noisy conquest of equal suffrage, not by any sentimental
interest in political palliatives may this emancipation be brought about. Because she is shy,
because she is self-effacing, we must not make the mistake of believing that the woman of Japan does
not conceal a treasury of wisdom stored up by the accumulated experience of centuries.</p>
<p>The Japanese woman of the future, it is my prophecy, will sacrifice not the slightest element of
her womanhood. Her self-realization will come through a gradual assertion of her power in her own
sphere rather than in that of men. Already the fine flower of a highly conscious civilization, she
will not sacrifice the beauties of the past for the uncertain gains of the future. Yet change is
inevitable. Our romanticists, our worshipers of the faraway, may be rudely disillusioned. But is it
a necessity that the women of the future must be less beautiful, less attractive than those of a
past society that is now irrevocable? I do not think so.</p>
<p>The costume of the Japanese woman seems symbolical of her present position and the future
unfolding of her nature. Today her kimono is her chrysalis. Outwardly it is of a dull, drab color,
of some thick, serviceable goods--a dull brown or black, shot through with threads of purple or
blue. It is often lined with silks of the brightest and most flaming hue, or which we catch only a
fleeting glimpse now and then. Such, it seems to me, is the very nature of the women of Japan.
Beneath her drab and often colorless exterior lies the unquenchable flame of her new spirit.</p>
