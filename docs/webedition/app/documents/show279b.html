		<h1>Debate on Birth Control: Second Speech</h1>
		<h3>Margaret Sanger</h3>
		<h1>SECOND SPEECH</h1>
		<p>Mrs. Sanger: There is no doubt that there are many ways of race suicide, but Mr. Russell has not proven to me yet that birth
			control is causing it. He has shown us--given the number of inhabitants in a block
			which, according to his ideas, are dying out. Those who have had no children--there is
			no reason to claim or to know just what is the cause of those people not having
			children. Many barren women today might be desirous of having children, and because
			sometimes of an infection given to her by her husband, she is unable to have
			children.</p>
		<p> Furthermore, for every block that Mr. Russell can produce in New York City, where they
			are controlling their numbers and where they are not having the numbers sufficient, to
			his satisfaction I can show you an equal number who are overdoing themselves.
			(Applause.) I can give him one block in New York City where there are 10,000 people, and
			in that same bloc, there are 10,000 homes, and but one airshaft between them. They are
			living cuddled together practically like animals and he will ask these people still to
			produce numbers to a greater extent than they have.</p>
		<p> When we talk about race suicide it seems to me that there are other things that one must
			consider. Birth control will improve the quality of the race, and unless we do improve
			the quality of the race, it is better that we do have race suicide. (Applause.)
			Certainly all of us who have lived within the past five years and have seen what has
			gone on in the world--we have seen the destruction of life--we have seen it so
			mercilessly taken--certainly there are other ways that race suicide is being put out
			upon the world other than birth control. War certainly has done something to wipe out
			the inhabitants of the earth. And if you go to Europe where I have been
			the last six months or so and see the condition of misery and unhappiness that is going
			on there, particularly in Central Europe, you would say that death would
			be a blessing to those people, instead of the hand of peace that has come to them. When
			I saw more than 15,000 little children in Germany that were born since
			the war, friends, brought into being in the most terrible conditions that any country
			could be in--those children were brought to birth because they, too, did not believe in
			birth control. They believe in numbers, in expansion, in more and more children, and
			today, those hundreds and hundreds of children have not backbone. They are almost unable
			to hold up their heads. They will be absolutely useless for another generation. Are
			these the kind of children we want to bring into the world? Don't we want quality
			instead of quantity?</p>
		<p>It seems to me it is time we used our intelligence and stopped the ranting phrases that
			we have been hearing so many of today. (Applause.)</p>
		<p>Again I say, Mr. Russell tells us that he was quite sick when he heard me tell about
			women who had tuberculosis and heart disease and other ailments, and should have been
			prevented from becoming pregnant. He said the man who did not have self-control was not
			worth much. I wonder if Mr. Russell knows--he is a lawyer, and I wonder if he knows what
			the laws of this State are as far as you men are concerned. The Bible states "wives, submit yourselves unto your
			husbands." It is one of the things put into our laws, and the woman who does not
			submit to her husband--he does not have to support her. I wonder if Mr. Russell knows
			that. I have myself had cases where women have come to me and said: "What
				shall I do. I have left this man. I can't have more children." And when she
			comes to court, the judge has said: "Are you willing to live with this man
				or not?" And she said: "I can't have more children. I don't want
				more children." And the judge has said: "You must adjust this
				matter for yourselves." The man did not have to support her unless she submitted
			her body to him. That is the condition today.</p>
		<p> We talk about self-control. I think none of us who look on the world know there is
			self-control. No one delves in self-control. That is one of the finest human instincts
			there is. When you see hungry people going around with plenty of food in front of them,
			I think there is self-control in the world. (Applause.) </p>
		<p>And don't forget this, that self-control--and I would like to ask anyone to contradict it
			that a man and woman may be ever so self-controlled and if they are not married and live
			in a marriage relationship-that it only means one embrace or one union to have a baby
			every year. The most self-controlled man and woman in the world can still have a family
			that man can't take care of. That is something to remember.</p>
		<p> On the other hand, if we mean, and if Mr. Russell would only talk so that we can
			understand him--plainly--I have to tell you what he means as a matter of fact. If Mr.
			Russell means that this relationship between man and woman should only be for
			procreation, then that is another matter. I wish he would say so. If it means you are
			going to have two children, then only two times in your life you should have
			union-that's another question. But our marriage laws are not based on that law. And it
			would have to be a strict understanding before a woman married, before that union or
			companionship or relationship could take place. I have no objection whatsoever to any
			individual who wish to live that way.</p>
		<p>But I am speaking for the millions of women who are crushed with over child-bearing,
			whose lives are broken and who have become drudges in the family today. I am speaking
			for the mothers and the individual here, and there does not concern me in the least.
			They may be an exception, but I know there are millions and millions of women who are
			married, who are just as self-controlled as anyone Mr. Russell can show us, who are
			living in terror of pregnancy and they have men who are just as good to them. Men are
			not all beasts. These people give you an idea that men are a lustful, beastly creature,
			looking to violate some woman's virtue. I wonder why a man does not stand up against
			that. They never do. It takes a woman to stand up for them. I know that most of the
			women that I have lived with-their husbands are men who are just as considerate and
			decent as anyone you can find. They are trapped in this ignorance. That is what is the
			matter.</p>
		<p> Our whole sexual education has been at fault. We have been kept in blinders. We have
			been taught that this relationship is a vital, terrible thing--put it out of your
			hearts. However, a marriage certificate is placed into your hands and Presto! everything
			is supposed to be made beautiful. (Applause and laughter.)</p>
		<p> Our married life and happiness depends upon education and it depends upon an attitude
			and an ideal attitude towards our relation, and we are not going to get it by blindness
			and by ignorances. We are going to get it by adjusting our own interests and our own
			intelligence to life as it is today, and I claim that any man living on the average
			workingman's wage today is not able to support some two or three children decently.
			There may be exceptions to that, but we have more than--I think it is something like
			40,000 or 50,000 people in this country who are living and dependent upon public
			charity, and every time a man and women does not have the conscious responsibility
			toward the children that they are going to bring into being, and have them according to
			Nature, as Mr. Russell would say, without regard to their protection, to preparing for
			their coming-that just as sure as we do that-the man's wage to do is unable to keep up
			with his reproductive power. That has been the history of labor; it has been the history
			of labor all the way down, and the man and women who brings to birth children that they
			can't take care of, it means you are going to pass that burden and the responsibility
			upon some one else. We have today in China this terrible poverty that is
			going on there. Thirty millions of people in China are starving to death. The Chinese
			have always lived according to Mr. Russell's theory, and they are appealing now to low
			birth rate countries, to those who have as a nation used birth control; they are
			appealing to them now to save some other millions of others in China and we have to do
			it. </p>
		<p>The responsibility always comes back upon those who have protected themselves, those who
			have lived within their own means, and according to their own intelligence.</p>
		<p> I am not going to take up all the time I have been allotted because I am quite through.
			I want to say in the first place birth control joins the fight against the transmission
			of venereal disease to the next generation. Birth control is the pivot around which
			every movement must swing making for race betterment. Birth control does not act as a
			substitute for any social scheme or other ideal system. But it must be the base and
			serve them as a foundation.</p>
		<p> Birth control will free the mother from the trap of pregnancy. It will save the child
			from that procession of coffins, as well as from the toil of mill and factory.</p>
		<p> Birth control will make parenthood a voluntary function instead of an accident as it is
			today. When motherhood and childhood is free, we then can go hand in hand with man, to
			remake the world, for the glorification as well as the emancipation of the human race.
			(Applause.)</p>
		<p>Mr. Gould: Mr. Russell will conclude the debate with a
			rebuttal period of fifteen minutes.</p>
