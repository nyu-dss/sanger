        <h1>Birth Control.</h1>
        
            <p>The year 1946 marked the 25th anniversary of the Planned Parenthood Federation
                    of America, Inc. (formerly the Birth Control Federation of
                    America). The year was distinguished by advances in the field of religious
                acceptance and by international recognition of family planning as an aid in solving
                population problems related to world peace.</p>
        
        
            <h2>International.&#8211;</h2>
            <p>Speaking before the International Health conference of the United Nations, Dr. Djamil Pasha Tutunji, health director of
                    Trans-Jordan, declared that birth control is as important to
                world peace as the control of the atom bomb.</p>
            <p>The first postwar international sex conference, attended by representatives of eight
                countries, was held in Stockholm, Sweden. Delegates from the
                unoccupied countries, where planned parenthood programs had been curtailed but not
                abolished, reported development of a three-fold program of child-spacing, treatment
                of infertility and education for marriage, in line with work of the U.S. group. Visiting physicians from
                    India, China, Japan, New
                    Zealand, Spain, Brazil,
                    Argentina, South Africa and Italy
                all reported growing awareness of the importance of planned parenthood in an
                over-all health program.</p>
        
        
            <h2>Religion.&#8211;</h2>
            <p>Recognizing that planned parenthood is one way to combat the country&#8217;s growing
                divorce, abortion and juvenile delinquency rates, the National Clergymen&#8217;s Advisory committee of the Planned Parenthood
                federation passed a resolution seeking the establishment of planned parenthood
                services in hospitals, public health clinics and other agencies where the service
                should be given. The resolution, signed by 3,200 Protestant and Jewish religious
                leaders, was given nation-wide publicity by the press. The united action of
                clergymen in favour of planned parenthood completed the year&#8217;s program which opened
                with an address by Bishop G. Bromley
                    Oxnam, president of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ
                    in America, before the 25th annual dinner.</p>
        
        
            <h2>Medical and Public Health.&#8211;</h2>
            <p>The New York Academy of Medicine conducted a survey of contraceptive
                services in New York city hospitals and found that
                only 5 of the city&#8217;s 89 hospitals had contraceptive clinics. The mistaken belief
                that birth control is illegal was believed to keep many patients from seeking
                medical advice on child-spacing from out-patient departments which they attended for
                other medical help. The New York academy report recommended that contraceptive
                information be made available when it was medically indicated. The addition of
                    Virginia and Mississippi to the states which
                include planned parenthood in their public health services brought the total number
                of such states to eight.</p>
        
        
            <h2>Press and Radio.&#8211;</h2>
            <p>Fifty-six articles making favourable mentions of planned parenthood appeared during
                the year in popular and technical magazines. Both the United Press and
                the Associated Press wire services carried the story of the clergymen&#8217;s
                resolution, and in many communities newspaper editors augmented the original story
                with statements from local clergymen whose names appeared among the 3,200
                signers.</p>
            <p>Radio&#8217;s attitude toward planned parenthood underwent a noticeable change during 1946.
                Bishop Oxnam&#8217;s address broadcast over the network of the Columbia Broadcasting
                    system was the most frank discussion of the religious significance of
                birth control ever heard on a network. The National Broadcasting Company
                gave the federation network time for a roundtable discussion of &#8220;Birth&#8211;By Choice or
                Chance.&#8221; Participants, who discussed the religious, medical and social aspects of
                planned parenthood were: Dr. Guy Emery
                    Shipler, editor of The Churchman; Dr.
                    Janet Fowler Nelson, newly appointed
                consultant on education for marriage and family living, for the federation; and Dr.
                    Alan F. Guttmacher, associate
                professor of obstetrics, Johns
                    Hopkins medical school. The program was transcribed and copies made
                available to planned parenthood groups for rebroadcast.</p>
            <p>The first series of planned parenthood programs was broadcast in the spring over
                    WFAS, White Plains, N.Y. Scheduled originally as a 13-week series, it was
                extended to 20 weeks, and the entire series was repeated over the same station in
                the fall. Scripts of this series were made available to all planned-parenthood
                leagues and committees.</p>
        
        
            <h2>Education.&#8211;</h2>
            <p>In addition to its extensive literature on child spacing, infertility, marriage
                counselling and population, the federation published two new pamphlets dealing with
                venereal disease and juvenile delinquency. The Story of Two Families,
                produced in co-operation with the Institute for Venereal Disease Education of
                        North Carolina, pointed out in popular cartoon style
                the relationship between venereal disease and parenthood. The Roots of
                    Delinquency stressed the fact that most juvenile delinquency began at
                home and was traceable in a large measure to irresponsible parents.</p>
        
        
            <h2>Fund Raising.&#8211;</h2>
            <p>Preparations were made for the first nationwide campaign for $2,000,000 to open in
                Feb. 1947. A portion of the money was to be used for research which it was hoped
                would lead to the development of a simple, inexpensive contraceptive and add to
                current knowledge of the treatment of infertility. The federation also hoped to
                expand its current program and establish new clinics which would place medically
                reliable methods of contraception within the reach of all married women regardless
                of geographical location or economic status.</p>
        
        
            <h2>Organization.&#8211;</h2>
            <p>The Planned Parenthood federation was the national agency and local clearinghouse for
                38 state leagues and more than 200 affiliated local committees. There were in 1946
                about 600 planned parenthood centres in hospitals, public health clinics and
                extramural clinics operated by volunteer committees.</p>
