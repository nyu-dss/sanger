        <h1>WHAT EVERY GIRL SHOULD KNOW</h1>
        <h3>By MARGARET H. SANGER.</h3>
        <h2>Puberty -- Part II. </h2>
        <p>Beginning with puberty the eggs from the ovary are expelled as they ripen or mature. This
            process is called ovulation and occurs about every twenty-eight days. It is closely
            related to menstruation but it is not menstruation as you will soon learn. </p>
        <p>Some writers say the egg is expelled at other times than at the menstrual periods;
            another writer asserts that one passes every six hours, alternating male and female.
            There are many views and ideas on the subject of ovulation, but I will tell you of the
            most generally accepted theory, that the egg is expelled from the ovary every
            twenty-eight days.</p>
        <p>When the eggs ripens, the ovary discharges it and sends it on to find its way through the
            tubes to the uterus. Here we find the blood supply of the uterus greatly increased in
            preparation for the egg. We find the inner lining of the uterus becomes very soft and
            smooth so that the egg can very easily find a place in which to lodge itself until it
            becomes fertilized. We also find that the cells swell and multiply, all in preparation
            to welcome and nourish the incoming egg or ovum. If the egg is fertilized by the male,
            it then remains in the uterus to develop. If not, it is thrown out, together with all
            the preparation made to receive it. The cells burst and discharge their contents; the
            mucus blood, cells and all come away in what is called the menstrual flow.</p>
        <p>At one time woman was thought to be the only creature which menstruated. But science now
            tells us that all warm blooded animals which walk erect menstruate. The discharge is
            chiefly due to the position which in standing upright throws the large part of the
            uterus higher than the neck. In animals, such as dogs, cats, etc., the same process goes
            on, but the position of these animals keeps the large part of the uterus lower than the
            small part, where the blood is retained and then reabsorbed into the system. </p>
        <p>This process goes on every four weeks in girls after they reach the age of puberty and
            continues at regular periods as long as the egg is not fertilized until the reproductive
            age is over, which is usually between the 45th and 50th year. If, however, the egg is
            fertilized the menstrual flow ceases and this blood supply goes to nourish the new life
            in the uterus. It does not appear again until after the birth of the child, and usually
            ceases while the child depends on the milk from the mammal glands. </p>
        <p>The age at which this process (menstruation) first takes place in girls differs in
            individuals. Climate has some effect upon it, for girls in warm or Southern climates
            mature earlier than in colder places. In this climate the average girl reaches puberty
            at 14 years of age. Some have been known to reach it as early as the 11th and others not
            until the 18th year, in all in the same place and yet normal and healthy, which shows
            there is no reason for anxiety if the girl does not menstruate at 14, provided she is
            developing normally and is in good health. During the first few years after its
            appearances the periods are likely to be irregular. This is because the sexual organs
            are not fully developed. Often the period does not occur after the first time for three,
            five, eight months, and sometimes a year. This irregularity continues for two or three
            years. Cases of girls coming from Europe have been known where the period
            was perfectly established over there, but after arriving in this climate the menstrual
            flow did not occur again for a year and over. Usually this irregularity lasts only a few
            months, and once it has become regular, there should be no worry over its arrival a day
            or two earlier or later.</p>
        <p>The length of time the period lasts differs in women also. The average length of time is
            four or five days, yet there are women in which it lasts fully a week, and others but a
            few hours. The length of time should not be of as much concern as the amount of
            discharge which is expelled each time. It is, of course, difficult to estimate this, but
            physicians claim that more than three protectives in twenty-four hours should not be
            used. In all women the flow is more profuse during the first two days. </p>
        <p>The care of the health should receive more attention during the first two days than is
            usually given it. To the girl who has to work from early morning until late at night,
            these two days are unusually hard on her nerves and on her general health, and I regret
            that I have no new message for her to help lighten the burden, which under the present
            atrocious industrial system makes it so hard for her.</p>
        <p>Physicians say there should be no need of interrupting the regular routine of the day at
            this time more than any other. There are a few strong women to whom this period makes no
            difference, but the average girl in this country spends two days of pain and discomfort.
            Out of 1,000 girls questioned, only 16 per cent were entirely free from pain, which
            proves that the time has come for women to cease being ashamed of this function, and
            insisting upon at least one day's rest at the expense of her employer. Some of the old
            biblical ideas instilling into the man's mind that a woman is unclean at this time has
            been the cause of much hardship and many sneers endured by a woman during these periods.
            The consequence has been that she will bear the most intense pain rather than allow the
            men working with her to suspect that she is menstruating. It is all nonsense and wrong,
            and it is time women should band together in one great sisterhood to protect one another
            from being slowly drained and exhausted of their powers of motherhood for the benefit of
            their exploiters. Women who belong to unions should demand that this day be given them
            and their sisters. Girls continue to suffer pains in the abdomen and back, pains running
            down the limbs, headache, often nausea, besides being nervous and irritable, yet hang on
            a strap in an overcrowded street car, stand or sit all day in the shop or at the machine
            and utter no protest. They know, too, they are not alone in this suffering, for they see
            about them day after day hundreds of other women enduring the same pain, yet they remain
            silent.</p>
        <p>How long will you endure this, working women?</p>
        <p>There is one thing to remember, that the greatest strain comes on the nervous system at
            this period. One of the best ways to assist in building up the nerve strength is in
            sleep and rest and for the girl who dares not remain away from the shop fearing to lose
            her "job" the next best thing is to get to bed early, for there is nothing that builds
            up the exhausted nerves like sleep. Fortunately, the girl at school has some
            consideration shown her at this time, and it is well that this is so, for until the
            period becomes established there is special danger of overdoing in school work, which
            often causes St. Vitus dance and other nervous disorders.</p>
        <p>I believe firmly in the regular warm tub bath, or cold sponge followed by a good rubbing
            all over the body at this time, together with nine or ten hours' sleep, and light
            nourishing food without stimulant. If the bowels are active, it often lessens the pain
            considerably, and it is very important that every girl attend to this if she has any
            regard for her health. There are a few abnormalities of the menstrual function which I
            will not take the space to state here. Before leaving the subject, I wish to impress
            upon the reader that most abnormalities, such as too little or too much flow, or very
            great exhausting pain are usually caused, not by any diseases of the generative organs,
            but more often a disturbance of the general health, which can often be treated and cured
            by building up the system.</p>
        <p>Every girl should learn the laws of menstruation and its hygiene and have a full
            understanding of the same. The menstrual function occurs only in the female at puberty,
            but at the same time there comes to both boys and girls, or male and female, a
            mysterious and impelling influence, which has great power over the lives of both during
            the adolescent period unless they understand and control it. This is known as the Sexual
            Impulse. It is of this I shall tell you next. </p>
