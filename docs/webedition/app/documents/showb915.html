            Stone, the medical director of the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, held in
                New York City.</p><hr>
    
    
    
        <p>MRS. MARGARET SANGER:</p>
        <p>Mr. Chairman and Friends. I think this is a nice idea. I
            think that being missed is something that we all like, but being thought of and
            remembered is even better. I like to be thought of and to be remembered, and I hope that
                Hannah Stone likes it too. To many Hannah
            was a personality rare and unique in this modern world. She had that rugged strength,
            combined with gentleness, and this was combined with a delightful sense of human and the
            gift of laughter. It is an old saying that you never know a person until you have lived
            with them, and I would like to add that you don't know them quite so well until you work
            with them, and you might add to that that when you work with them and you have obstacles
            to overcome, hardships and difficulties to meet day after day, that in the course of a
            lifetime you know each other pretty well. In the years that Hannah Stone and I worked
            together I found many splendid and remarkable qualities in her, and I am going to speak
            about just four, which, because she had these qualities, and they were not
            abstract,-they were qualities of character and personality,-because she had these that
            the birth control movement is where it is today. These qualities were courage, vision,
            skill and competence, and integrity.</p>
        <p>The first was courage. Her courage began with the very day that she decided to come and
            stand beside me in the birth control movement. Friends, it took courage at that time. I
            had to have a doctor. According to the law of New York State, only a
            doctor could give contraceptive instruction for the cure or prevention of disease. I was
            not a doctor, I was only a trained nurse, the stooges of the doctors, so I had to have a
            doctor, but it was not any kind of a doctor. I was particular what kind of doctor I
            wanted. I wanted a woman, she must be married. She must have children, or at least know
            something of motherhood, she had to have the kind of nature that understood human
            beings, that had to love them, had to try to solve their problems. She understood them
            and this indeed was where the birth control movement was fortunate that Hannah Stone
            came and stood beside us and became the Medical Director of the first birth control clinic in this
            country. She had to show her courage very definitely when she took her stand. She was at
            the time connected with one of the most outstanding and largest obstetrical hospitals in the city and I have a letter
            here where she was ordered to come before the Chief of Staff of that hospital, and to
            take her choice, that she could not remain in that hospital on its staff and at the same
            time be in the birth control clinic. And she took her stand. And for a young woman just,
            we might say, rising with her foot on the ladder of success, because success she
            certainly would have attained, to have taken that stand when the movement was by no
            means popular, there was nothing she could gain, except to be sure that inner joy of
            service. And today that same hospital has a flourishing contraceptive service for the
            patients who are in that institution. So her courage and her choice have been vindicated
            by time.</p>
        <p>The next is her vision. She was with me but a short time when Hannah Stone realized that
            if we were going to do at all what we wanted to do that we were tremendously handicapped
            by lack of materials or supplies that had to be smuggled in from Europe.
            She then began to devise a formula, a chemical formula. Together with one of our
            co-workers, Dr. James Cooper, she got up this
            formula which today is really serving as the basis of almost all chemical contraceptives
            in this country and abroad. And she was not content to allow it to be commercialized or
            to keep it a patent for herself, but she insisted that the formula be given to her
            colleagues in the medical profession and to spread it through medical channels and
            medical publications. That was the vision Hannah Stone had, that all who were working in
            the field of human endeavor of health should have access to this particular information
            that she had brought forth.</p>
        <p>The next, that was very definitely expressed and shown, was her competence and skill. In
            1929, when the little clinic that we had on 15th Street was raided by the police and
            Hannah Stone and her co-workers were hauled off to court, she had to show them that she
            was within her medical rights, that this decoy patient who was sent by the police to
            trap her so that the clinic might be closed, she had to show and prove that she had the
            knowledge of the law and that she was keeping within the law. The police in their raid
            took many cards and especially history records and there indeed, when these were viewed
            by the authorities, they found that she had been very competent in her directorship,
            that the findings of the patients indicated that ...... were absolutely within the laws
            of this state. Hannah Stone not only gave to the medical profession in this state
            another verification of their rights, but she also established in the public mind the
            truth that that clinic was maintained under ethical and medical standards. I must say
            right here that the medical profession in New York
                City, the Academy of Medicine, behaved magnificently, they came
            to court, they stood splendidly behind her, and for that I am sure she rejoiced to the
            end of her time.</p>
        <p>Then, not content with putting Hannah Stone through all these tests, I had to ask her to
            do one thing more. The Federal law had to be challenged, but it was a law that had been
            on our statute books for over sixty years, which claimed that no one, not even a
            physician, could send anything through the United State mails or common
            carriers which gave information to prevent conception, a book a chart, a leaflet, a
            pamphlet, or an article designed for such a purpose, and that law had never been
            challenged, and so a number of articles had been sent to me from Japan
            and they were promptly destroyed by the customs officials, and I went to Hannah Stone
            and said -- I would like another package to be sent for our Research Bureau, I would
            like them to be sent to you. It is a great deal to ask you to do because it means going
            to courts, staying around for days and days, having publicity that is not always
            pleasant, and your license might even be taken away as a practicing physician. How about
            it? And that is here Hannah Stone's integrity was proven. Without hesitation she said
                "of course, of course". And so the package was sent to her from
            Japan. We had our attorney, a very skillful and prominent attorney, and then again she
            went through many days sitting in the courts and going through with her trial that is a
            very difficult thing for any sensitive person, <span class="del">but then again she went through many
                days sitting in the courts an going through with her trial hat is a vey difficult
                thing for any sensitive person,</span> but again she won out by the depth of her
            spirit! By her knowledge a decision was rendered that a physician could receive such
            articles and could send them through the mails and common carriers for the patient's
            health or general well-being. So again another victory was won for the members of her
            profession. Another milestone was passed. Hannah Stone <span class="del">and she</span> also made it
            possible for the birth control movement to have immunity. Now she as a physician was
            familiar with the phenomenon of birth, and she as a physician was familiar with the
            phenomenon of death, and it was between these two extremes that she was concerned. She
            like many of us here tonight, was concerned in making way for the unborn child, of
            making a way here and now, that it might better fulfill its destiny, and just as Hannah
            Stone was making way for the unborn here, I like to think that she has joined those
            splendid forces who make a way for us over there.</p>
