        <h1>
       &#8593;Hotel Brevoort&#8595;
    
            
       &#8593;Maiden Speech&#8595;
             
        </h1>
                <p>It seems to me that this evening and this gathering are significant and important, not
            only because the idea of birth control has brought together <span class="del">all of us</span> workers
            of such diverse outlook and temperament, but especially because
            of the time chosen for it--the eve of my trial. . . .<span class="del">and because of the dignified and
                representative intelligence which has supported me in this battle</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="del">FOR</span> I realize keenly that many of those who understand and would support <span class="del">the</span> birth control propaganda if it were carried out in a safe and sane manner, cannot
            sympathize with nor countenance the methods I have followed in my attempt to arouse <span class="del">the</span>
            working women to the fact that bringing a child into the world is the greatest
            responsibility.</p>
        <p>They tell me that The Woman Rebel was badly written; that
            it was crude; that it was emotional, 
       &#8593;and&#8595;
     hysterical; that it mixed issues;
            that is was defiant, and too radical.</p>
        <p>WELL, to all of these indictments I plead guilty! I know that <span class="del">any, and
                perhaps</span> all of you are better able to cope with the subject than I am. I know
            that physicians and scientists have a great technical fund of information--greater than
            I had on the subject of family limitation.</p>
        <p>THERE is nothing new, nothing radical in birth control. Aristotle
            advocated it; Plato advocated it; all our great <span class="del">and</span> modern
            thinkers have advocated it!</p>
        <p>It is an idea that must appeal to any mature intelligence.</p>
        <p><span class="del">But</span>
            
       &#8593;Yet&#8595;
     all this scientific and technical discussion has 
       &#8593;only&#8595;
     had the
            effect of producing more technical and scientific discussion--all very necessary and
            very stimulating to that very small group of men and women who could understand it.</p>
        <p>BUT, all during the long years <span class="del">while</span> this matter <span class="del">was being</span>
            
       &#8593;has been&#8595;
     discussed, advocated, refuted, the people themselves--<span class="del">the</span> poor
            people especially--were blindly, desperately practicing family limitation--just as
            they are practicing it today.</p>
        <p><span class="del">BUT</span> To them birth control does not mean what it does to us.</p>
        <p>TO THEM it has meant the most barbaric methods. It has meant the killing of
            babies--infanticide,--abortions,--in one crude way or another.</p>
        <p>WOMEN, from time immemorial, have tried to avoid unwanted motherhood.</p>
        <p>WE ALL KNOW the tribe of professional abortionists which has sprung up and profited by
            this terrible misfortune.</p>
        <p>WE KNOW, TOO, that when the practice of abortion was put under the ban by the
            church, <span class="del">the</span>``
            
       &#8593;an&#8595;
     alternate evil--the foundling asylum, with its horrifying history--sprang
            up.</p>
        <p>THERE IS NO NEED to go into the terrible facts concerning the recklessness, the misery,
            the filth, with which children have been and still are being brought into the world.</p>
        <p>I merely want to point out the situation I found when I entered the battle.</p>
        <p>ON THE ONE HAND, I found the wise men, <span class="del">the</span> sages, <span class="del">the</span> scientists,
            discussing birth control among themselves.</p>
        <p>But their ideas were sterile. They did not influence nor affect the tremendous facts of
            life among the working classes and the disinherited!</p>
        <p>HOW COULD I <span class="del">APPROACH</span>
            
       &#8593;Bridge&#8595;
     THIS CHASM? How could I reach these people? How could I awaken public
            opinion to this tremendous problem?</p>
        <p>I MIGHT HAVE TAKEN up <span class="del">the</span>
            
       &#8593;a&#8595;
     policy of safety, sanity and conservatism--but would I have got a hearing?</p>
        <p>AND AS I BECAME MORE AND MORE CONSCIOUS of the vital importance of this idea, I felt
            myself in the position of one who has discovered that a house is on fire; and I found
            that it was up to me to shout out the warning!</p>
        <p>THE TONE OF THE VOICE may have been indelicate and unladylike, and was not at all the
            tone than many of us would rather hear.</p>
        <p>BUT THIS VERY GATHERING--this honor you have thrust upon me--is ample proof that
            intelligent and constructive thought has been aroused.</p>
        <p>SOME OF US may only be fit to dramatize a situation--to focus attention upon obsolete
            laws, like this one I must face tomorrow morning.</p>
        <p>THEN, others, more experienced in constructive organization, can gather together all this
            sympathy and interest which has been aroused, and direct it.</p>
        <p>I THANK YOU for your encouragement and support. <span class="del">AND</span> MY REQUEST TO YOU TONIGHT
            is that all you social workers--so much better fitted to carry on this work than I--that
            you consider and organize this interest.</p>
        <p>THIS IS THE MOST NEXT IMPORTANT STEP AND ONLY IN THIS WAY CAN I BE VINDICATED!!</p>
        <p>
            
       &#8593;Let us put U S. of A upon the map of
                the civilized world!&#8595;
