        <h1>Birth Control.</h1>
        <p>The Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., formerly the Birth
                Control Federation of America, Inc. made marked advances in 1943,
            concentrating on five programs of activity.</p>
        
            <h1 class="sub">Public Health.</h1>
            <p>-- Five more states initiated cooperative efforts with the federation to include
                pregnancy spacing in their public health services -- bringing the total number of
                states to eleven. The federation became a member of the National Health
                    Council.</p>
            <p><span class="">Clinical Service.</span> -- On Dec. 1, 1943 birth control services totalled
                786; 211 in hospitals; 286 in public health quarters; 288 extra-mural; 372 of total
                supported in whole or part by public funds. Services for treatment of sterility were
                listed in the federation&#8217;s Clinic Directory.</p>
        
        
            <h1 class="sub">Industrial Hygiene.</h1>
            <p>-- Absenteeism, due often to pregnancy or induced abortion, became an acute problem
                in many areas, as millions of women went into war work. the division of industrial
                hygiene, U.S.P.H. service,
                recommended, in an outline for use in industry, that &#8220;advice on the
                    proper spacing of children, as a means of protecting the health of the mother
                    and her children&#8221;, be given married women workers, by counsellors in plants.
                Dr. Eva Dodge, the federation&#8217;s assistant medical
                director, surveyed a number of plants, and, in co-operation with the
                    Alabama state health department, assisted in preparing two
                pamphlets on this problem, for use by workers and management. A radio transcription,
                    &#8220;Freedom From Fear&#8221;, dealing with the problem of
                absenteeism, due to pregnancy, was produced by the federation for use of its state
                leagues.</p>
        
        
            <h1 class="sub">Education.</h1>
            <p><span class="">Medical.</span> -- Over 11,000 copies of Dr. Robert L. Dickinson&#8217;s pamphlet, &#8220;Techniques of Conception Control&#8221;, were sent on request to
                physicians, bringing the total to 56,000 issued on request to this group, and 17,000
                were sent to registered nurses on request.</p>
            <p>Birth control training institutes for public health nurses were held in
                    Florida, Delaware and North
                    Carolina.</p>
            <p><span class="">Research.</span> -- Although no new discoveries were made during the year, a
                special committee of the council on pharmacy and chemistry of the American
                    Medical Association continued research in chemical contraceptives, and the
                council on physical therapy initiated a co-operative program dealing with mechanical
                articles and devices. Reports appear in the Journal of the
                    American Medical Assn. for Dec. 18, 1943.</p>
            <p><span class="">Social Work.</span> -- A new pamphlet, &#8220;The Case Worker and
                    Family Planning&#8221;, was sent upon request to 2,000 social workers. The
                federation participated, as a kindred group, in the National Conference of
                    Social Work. A newly formed advisory committee directed work in this
                field.</p>
            <p><span class="">Negro Program.</span> -- The division of Negro Service, with its advisory council of 46, and
                sponsoring committee of 146 members, representing national professional, medical,
                religious and civic leadership, was strengthened, and a pamphlet, &#8220;Better Health for 13,000,000" published, reporting on the
                program of family planning for Negroes.</p>
            <p><span class="">Religious.</span> -- The National Clergymen&#8217;s Advisory council was organized with almost 1000
                members from 46 states. Organization of the council, and election of officers was
                undertaken, and a pamphlet on &#8220;Marriage Counsel&#8221;, for use
                of the clergy published.</p>
        
        
            <h1 class="sub">Teaching in Medical Schools.</h1>
            <p>-- To stimulate better teaching of contraception in medical schools, Dr. W.E. Brown of Cincinnati Medical School,
                visited 26 grade A colleges, for the federation, finding some teaching of the
                subject in each. His teaching Syllabus was distributed to grade A schools throughout
                the U.S., 45% of which were giving some
                instruction in 1943.</p>
        
        
            <h1 class="sub">State Organizations.</h1>
            <p>--In 9 affiliated states, Maryland, Delaware,
                    West Virginia, Virginia, Florida,
                    Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee and
                    Missouri, programs were broadened and strengthened by addition of
                professional staff members and executives. One more state, Ohio,
                became affiliated, bringing the total to 34.</p>
            <p><span class="">Legal.</span> -- The U.S. Supreme
                    Court refused the Tileston case involving the right of Connecticut doctors
                to advise contraceptives where life or health were threatened.</p>
            <p><span class="italics">Massachusetts Referendum.</span> -- Although over
                half a million votes were cast in its favour, the referendum to amend the state law
                so that doctors might legally advise patients on contraception failed of
                passage.</p>
        
        
            <h2>International.</h2>
            <p> -- The war made organized work in occupied Europe impossible. In
                    Great Britain educational work, clinical service and research
                were continued by the Family Planning Association. In
                    Australia the law passed in 1942 did not interfere with clinical
                work. Health boards in Bermuda planned wider disemination of birth
                control information, to cope with the problem of overpopulation there.</p>
            <p>Birth rates fell in most of Europe but were higher than in years in Great Britain. In
                the United States they were higher than for 20 years past. (See also Birth
                Statistics)</p>
