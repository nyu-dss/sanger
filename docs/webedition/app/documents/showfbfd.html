        <h1>Midwives Annual</h1>
        <p>Perhaps it can be said without question that the two Professions in the Modern World
            where there is the closest relationship between the professional &amp; laymen is the
            Midwives &amp; Nurse (practical) professions-- </p>
        <p>It is truly a great privilege to belong to either group. -- but a privilege only if the
            nurse or midwife&#8217;s heart is completely in the work. She must love people. She must love
            to care for them regardless of race, sex or creed. This caring for people &amp; caring
            to make them well &amp; healthy must be her religion if she is to be a success &amp; be
            happy in her job. It is not the same with a Doctor of Medicine -- He has the Scientific
            abstract -- objective approach toward his patient. Patients become cases in many
            illnesses. He shares his opinion his skills his treatments &amp; results with his fellow
            members of his profession. He is happy in a different way &amp; for a different reason
            than the Nurse or Midwife who may be helping him obtain his results. </p>
        <p>While the necessity &#8220;to earn ones bread by the sweat of the brow&#8221; cab be
            100% true in nursing the sick -- it should never be forgotten that a long range view of
            the patients health by those attending care produce butter &amp; jam on the bread &amp;
            not bread alone. </p>
        <p>When during the early years of the beginning of our educational campaign on birth control
            it has the usual question on the lips of obstetricians &amp; gynecologists &amp;
            midwives ask -- where will we end in our practice if women practice birth control and
            cease to have children -- The answer is that women have not ceased having children --
            they have spaced their pregnancies through knowledge of contraceptives. They have born
            fewer but healthy babies during the years. Instead of a baby every 18 months or two
            years totaling six children in ten year. Sometimes seven or eight, with disease, of
            deficiency, debts -- hunger, nervous disorder of parents &amp; children.</p>
        <p>The parents have born two or three children spaced two &amp; a half to three years
            between, giving the mother an opportunity to recuperate from the ordeal of one birth a
            rest and a period to prepare her body &amp; nervous condition for the coming of the next
            wanted baby. A wanted baby has the feeling of security all its life. By wanted I mean
            wanted before conception not after birth. We all love &amp; want to keep alive the baby
            after we see it &amp; nurse it. </p>
        <p>While I was the <span class="underline">one person</span> leading the Educational work
            throughout the English Speaking world who stood out strongly for Medical Control of the
            BC Clinic, I still believe it was the correct procedure even tho it was 
        [<em>many
                years</em>?]
