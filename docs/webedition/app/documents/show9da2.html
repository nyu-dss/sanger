        <h1>WHAT EVERY GIRL SHOULD KNOW</h1>
        <h3>By MARGARET H. SANGER. </h3>
        <h2>Part II--Reproduction.</h2>
        <p>In the first part of this subject I said that if the process of labor occurs before the
            seventh month (which is the earliest time the foetus can live for any length of time
            outside the womb) it is known as abortion or miscarriage. When labor occurs later than
            this or within two weeks before term, it is known as premature labor. </p>
        <p>The average girl in using the word abortion, has in mind a criminal act, whereby the
            process of pregnancy is purposely interrupted. She prefers the word miscarriage. </p>
        <p>There is also the belief among girls that a miscarriage occurring in the early stages of
            pregnancy can be brought about without bad results or any serious consequences to her
            health.</p>
        <p>It is a mistake to regard an abortion as of slight importance, for any interruption in
            the process of pregnancy is always more dangerous than the natural labor at full term.
            One writer claims there are more women ill in consequences of abortion than from full
            term childbirth, on account of which there are so many women who are semi-invalids.</p>
        <p>There can be no doubt that the often excessive loss of blood leaves the girl in a weak
            and rundown condition thereby lessening her powers of resistance to other diseases.</p>
        <p>The shock to the girl's system is greater than that produced by natural labor, and
            consequently leaves her in a hysterical and often critically nervous state for some time
            after.</p>
        <p>The causes of abortion are many. Among them are overexertion, overexcitement, shock,
            fright, fall, great anger, dancing, fatigue, lifting heavy weights, purgative medicines
            and excessive sexual intercourse.</p>
        <p>The dangers resulting from abortion are blood poison, hemorrhage -- even lockjaw has been
            known to be the result of abortion, also the danger that one miscarriage is likely to
            follow another, and disables a woman to carry a child to the full term.</p>
        <p>If there is the same care and treatment given the woman who aborts as the woman in
            childbirth, it will naturally be less likely to suffer serious results than if no
            medical attention were given her.</p>
        <p>One of the most common disturbances of pregnancy is nausea, more commonly called "morning
            sickness," because it is felt in the morning when the woman first assumes the erect
            position. As a rule, this lasts only during the early months.</p>
        <p>About the latter part of the fourth month, or often not before the fifth month, movements
            of the foetus are felt. These movements are called "life," and women are glad of this
            signal that all is progressing naturally. One writer said a woman had described the
            first feeling of life as "the trembling movements of a bird within my
                hand."</p>
        <p>There are often many nervous manifestations accompanying the pregnant woman, such as
            headache, neuralgia, toothache and as a usual thing constipation is always present, and
            should receive attention. The teeth should also receive attention at this time for they
            decay easily on account of the secretions in the mouth which are increased during
            pregnancy.</p>
        <p>The breasts enlarge in the early months of pregnancy, and there is a fullness and
            tingling felt often in the fifth week. The nipples become erect and the skin around the
            nipple becomes dark brown. These are only a few of the disturbances of pregnancy, but
            enough to show that other organs beside the uterus are tested in strength and how
            important it is to have a good healthy body. In fact, every tissue and fiber in the
            woman's body feels the impetus of pregnancy, and all kinds of physical changes
            occur.</p>
        <p>One of the common questions asked by young women in early married life is how to tell if
            they are pregnant.</p>
        <p>This is not always easy, but there are a few points on which a diagnosis is based, namely
            : in a healthy woman (during the reproductive age) the function of menstruation stops,
            together with morning sickness, and the enlargement of the breasts with dark color
            around the nipples, are early indications that pregnancy exists. I am not going to take
            the time nor space to explain that all three of the above named can exist in nervous
            women, even when pregnancy does not exist. It is, as I said in earlier articles, with
            the average healthy girl I am dealing, not with the exception. The only certain signs of
            pregnancy are the hearing of the heart beats of the child and its movements.</p>
        <p>Another question which troubles young women is how to count the time when she will be
            confined. This, too, is difficult to say, for an error of two weeks earlier or later is
            possible, because the time of conception is seldom definitely known. Experience has
            given a method of arriving at an approximate date which is used and which answers the
            purpose fairly well though it is by no means perfect. Add seven days to the first day of
            the last menstruation and count nine months forward. For example, Mrs. A menstruated
            last, beginning October 5; add seven days: this brings the date to October 12; add nine
            months, which brings the date of confinement to July 12. It is well to have every thing
            prepared two weeks before this date so that the woman can be as much as possible in the
            open air during the remaining waiting days. </p>
        <p>The dress of the pregnant woman should receive serious attention. In the first place, it
            should be simple and warm, without bands restricting the circulation of any part of the
            body, like skirt bands, round garters, corsets and tight shoes. The secret of a
            comfortable outfit for the expectant mother is to have all clothing hang from the
            shoulders. Combination underwear can be bought as reasonably as the separate drawers and
            shirt. There should be no pressure on the womb from above, rather let all support come
            from below. The corset gets in its harmful work by pressing down the uterus into the
            pelvis, thus displacing the abdominal organs and crowding them together in such a way as
            to cause injury to the uterus as well as to the child itself. The muscles of the uterus
            and abdomen are weakened and from this results that horror of all women, "the high
            stomach." Some women, especially those having children, prefer to wear in the latter
            days of pregnancy an abdominal supporter. If it is well fitted to the body it helps to
            assist the abdominal muscles in carrying the weight and affords great relief. If women
            would devote to making themselves comfortable during pregnancy as much time as they give
            on the baby's outfit, they would profit by it. Instead of wearing any old worn out
            dress, ill fitting and out of style, make one "maternity" dress to fit the figure. This
            can, of course, be let out in size as the figure grows. It can be made of some pretty,
            inexpensive material and gives much comfort and ease to the mind as well as to the body
            that the woman who has once had one will never again do without one.</p>
        <p>The food also should be simple. In fact, there are few restrictions to be placed on food
            unless so ordered by the physician. One common mistake of women is that they believe
            they are eating for two persons and, consequently, must gorge themselves, which, of
            course, results in indigestion. Physicians advise a small amount of meat once a day.
            Plenty of water, milk and cereals, fruit, vegetables and especially fruits, which
            loosens the bowels. Rich pastry or starches fried in fat should not be eaten, because
            they are hard to digest. There is no reason why the diet should be at all strict unless
            the woman is under the special care of a physician. She should take a moderate amount of
            exercise every day, but should not get tired. Walking in the open air in the sunlight is
            best. Avoid dancing, swimming and all violent exercise; sewing on the sewing machine
            should be restricted. Fainting in the early months is often caused from the bad air in
            overcrowded and overheated rooms, also from an empty stomach when the woman is too busy
            to notice nature's call for nourishment. </p>
        <p>There is little more to be said here except that a pregnant woman should be mentally and
            physically active, though not fatigued. And of all things she should keep out of the
            hearing of old superstitions, which have a sign for every act and keep a young woman
            constantly worried. She should not be allowed to worry over her approaching labor, and
            as far as possible be kept cheerful and happy.</p>
        <p>At the end of the period the child and the placenta are expelled from the uterus. The
            uterus gradually returns to its former size. It requires about six weeks for this to
            occur and it is very important that there should be no heavy lifting and overwork at
            this time. As a rule after childbirth the woman's form becomes matured and more
            developed. The facial expression takes on a kinder, a maternal look, the whole nervous
            system is awakened to sympathy, pain or grief bringing tears to the eyes quicker than
            ever before. Especially is this true for the first few years following.</p>
        <p>The important thing is that the care of the pregnant woman should be begun in girlhood.
            If we are going to be and have mothers, then we should give attention to the development
            of the organs which make us mothers.</p>
        <p>I shall now leave the mother with her new happiness and her new world to take up next
            week the subject of Ignorance and its Consequences. </p>
        (To be continued.)
