        <h3>MARGARET SANGER</h3>
        New York, N.Y.
        <p>Hannah Mayer Stone come to take her stand
            beside me in 1923. The birth control movement at that time had to prove itself. It had
            to prove to the medical profession that it had more than theories to go on -- it had to
            have facts, records, experience and knowledge before that august and conservative body
            would acknowledge its importance or existence. Without a doctor this could not be
            attempted in New York. Few doctors wanted to take the risk of identifying
            themselves with the birth control cause, the risk of becoming a martyr, of losing
            professional license or standing, of being expelled from their medical societies.</p>
        <p> Dr. Stone saw this situation clearly, but her spirit, her courage, and her vision
            decided the issue. In 1925 she became Medical Director of the Birth Control
                Clinical Research Bureau, a post which she held until her passing, serving
            during all these years as a volunteer, without any other remuneration than the
            satisfaction of seeing her efforts bear rich fruit.</p>
        <p>When on July 10, she passed over to the Great Beyond, her going was not only a tragic
            loss to the birth control movement, but also to the thousands of women whose personal
            problems she had studied and helped to solve. Many of these women came again and again
            to the Bureau to see her and to seek her guidance, and to them her loss is irreparable.
            It was to her infinite patience, her attention to details, her understanding of human
            frailities, her sympathy, her gentleness -- to all these qualities of mind and
            personality, that these thousands of mothers owed their peace of mind, marital harmony,
            health, and yes, in many cases, life itself. She was indefatigable in her efforts to
            work out special methods of contraception for the very difficult cases, methods suited
            to their individual peculiarities. Thousands caller her blessed.</p>
        <p>On looking back over these many years of her comradeship, one sees the landmarks she has
            set. No one, certainly, had more thoroughly explored the clinical aspects of
            contraception. From 1923 to 1941, we have assembled at the Bureau nearly 100,000 medical
            and social histories of the patients who came to us, a mighty array of factual evidence
            of what birth control can do and has done. Thanks to her guidance and direction these
            case histories have already proved to be of unique value and will continue to represent
            a wealth of social and medical material for future studies.</p>
        <p>It was she who, with Dr. James F. Cooper, was
            most responsible for the introduction of the knowledge of contraceptive techniques to
            the medical profession. Her &#8220;Theraputic Contraception,&#8221; a report
            presented in 1928, was the first factual clinical study on contraception to be published
            in any medical journal in this country. Her numerous lectures before medical and public
            health organizations always resulted in a clarification of the subject. Her clear cut
            and logical presentation, her serenity, dignity, modesty, her gay laughter and stubborn
            insistence on professional standards, brought clarity, conviction and illumination to
            her audiences. Thousands of medical students and physicians came to the Bureau to
            observe her techniques and receive instruction under her, and many of the physicians who
            now direct and serve in birth control centers all over the country received their
            initial training and stimulus from Dr. Hannah Stone.</p>
        <p>At the same time her valiant stands in court for the right of the physician to prescribe
            contraceptives have been vindicated time and again and have brought increased freedom
            for the medical profession. It was in a large measure due to her courage and her work
            that the birth control movement has marched steadily forward.</p>
        <p>Contact with the troubled women who consulted her at the Bureau by the thousands
            convinced her that there was a wide field for marriage counseling, and together with her
            husband, Dr. Abraham Stone, she began another
            great pioneer task. In 1931 they opened the first Consultation Center in New York City, first under the auspices of the
                Labor Temple, and later of the Community Church in New York. To this service they brought a warm and
            sympathetic understanding of the human problems which wreck so many marriages. Because
            of their unusual and close companionship, and the rarely happy marriage which they had
            achieved, Dr. Hannah Stone and her husband were uniquely fitted as marriage counselors.
            Their joint book &#8220;A Marriage Manual&#8221; is doubtless the most widely read
            textbook in this field and constitutes a veritable monument to sanity and
            understanding.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hannah Stone had a Madonna-like beauty which, coupled with her kindliness and
            graciousness, seemed a fitting complement to her position, and inspired confidence in
            all who met her. Her death is a great loss to me personally. But I know that her
            influence is not gone, it will carry on and on in an ever-widening circle. So we not
            only say &#8220;Farewell,&#8221; but we add &#8220;and Hail!&#8221;</p>
