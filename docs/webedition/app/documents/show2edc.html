            the Tucson Planned Parenthood clinic, who were at a tea held at her home.</p><hr>
    
    
    
        <p>Friends of P.P.</p>
        <p>In spirit I welcome you all here today-- Regret exceedingly that I have been detained in
            LA.</p>
        <p>The International situation in relation to Birth Control &amp; Population has grown to
            such an extent that much help must be given in advice, lectures, articles &amp;
            organizations.</p>
        <p>India especially &amp; Japan as well are buzzing with
            interest.</p>
        <p>Dr Stone the medical Director of our Bureau in N.
                Y. was invited by the W.H.O. in
                Geneva to go to India to set up Pilot
            clinics under the guidance of the Director of Public
                Health in India.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Nehru came out in the open in his
            address on Public Welfare to advise Birth Control centers through out India.</p>
        <p>This is a great Victory for the International movement that others with less courage
            previously now dare to endorse the work--</p>
        <p>The International
                Committee in London of which I am an
            American representative has been invited to hold the next BC Conference in India in
            1952.</p>
        <p>Plans are proceeding toward this event-- The date as to month &amp; day has yet to be
            decided but we may say November--in Bombay or New Dehli-- Other Int Conferences on Child
                Welfare &amp; Social Work are
            being held in Dec at Madras-- We are asked to
            cooperate with these agencies &amp; are of course happy to do so. Japan
            is another interesting country-- The Japanese people are awake to the problem of over
            population.</p>
        <p>I am invited again to go to Japan--a meeting of 3000 men &amp; women on Dec 6--issued an
            invitation to me to come to Japan in the Spring of 52. But as we who are going to India
            will pass through Japan--we are asking to be allow us to stop at that time instead of
            making a trip to Japan in the Spring--</p>
        <p>Singapore has several BC Clinics, the government has given $5000.00 for
            supplies to the 7 clinics in that locality. All over the world the idea is
            spreading--and now you will soon receive a news Bulletin--with International News. Edited by my friend
                Mrs Charles F Brush in New York. This
            is only a four sheet News Bulletin, we hope to have money enough within a year to make
            it a real magazine-- It's bubbling with news &amp; most encouraging to us all.</p>
        <p>I am to be on T.V. in Hollywood to debate the
            question of BC &amp; its importance to Civilization. The opponent is a R. Catholic mother of nine children. There is the
            possibility of my returning on time for this meeting but here are a few of the
            Highlights in case I am delayed.</p>
        <p><span class="del">You are so welcome to be in my home-- The Tucson Group will continue to do the
                splendid work begun several years ago--</span></p>
